    <system_requirements_note>The Catalog Ingest Tool was specifically developed under Sun Java Version 1.6. It has been tested under Sun Java version 1.6 and should run on any platform where Sun Java is supported. The tool should also run under other Java Runtime Environments (JREs) assuming they are compatible with Sun's Java 1.6.</system_requirements_note>
    <description>The Catalog Ingest Tool (CITool) is intended to streamline the ingestion process. The legacy process involves a myriad of tools and manual steps in order to ingest catalog files submitted by the nodes into the PDS central catalog. CITool offers three functions to compare, validate and ingest catalog submissions. The comparison function is intended for both Discipline Node and Engineering Node Data Engineers to determine the differences between previous submissions and a current submission. The validation function is also intended for both Discipline Node and Engineering Node Data Engineers to validate a current submission including checks for referential integrity. The ingestion function is intended for the Engineering Node Operator to ingest the current submission into the PDS central catalog.</description>
