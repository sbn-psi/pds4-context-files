The ROVER_MOTION_COUNTER element provides a set of integers which describe
a (potentially) unique location (position/orientation) for a rover. Each
time an event occurs that moves, or could potentially move, the rover, a
new motion counter value is created. This includes intentional motion due
to drive commands, as well as potential motion due to other articulating
devices, such as arms or antennae. This motion counter (or part of it) is
used as a reference to define instances coordinate systems which can move
such as SITE or ROVER frames. The motion counter is defined in a mission-
specific manner. Although the original intent was to have incrementing
indices (e.g., MER), the motion counter could also contain any integer
values which conform to the above definition, such as time or spacecraft
clock values.
 
Note: For MER, the motion counter consists of five values. In order, they
are Site, Drive, IDD, PMA, and HGA. The Site value increments whenever a
new major Site frame is declared. The Drive value increments any time
intentional driving is done. Each of those resets all later indices to 0
when they increment. The IDD, PMA, and HGA increment whenever the
corresponding articulation device moves. It is TBD whether IDD, PMA, and
HGA are independent of each other, or reset the others to 0 in a
hierarchical manner when they are incremented. Conceptually, a sixth value
could be added by ground processing to indicate unintentional slippage
(e.g., the wind blew the rover off a rock). This sixth value will never
occur in telemetry but might occur in certain RDR&apos;s. (Implementation of
this is TBD).
