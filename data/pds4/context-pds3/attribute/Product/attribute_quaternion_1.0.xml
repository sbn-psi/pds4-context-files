        <definition>
       The QUATERNION element specifies a quaternion, which is a
four-component representation of a rotation matrix.  This particular
definition is focused on the PDS use of quaternions; one should refer
to other sources for a more complete discourse on quaternion math.
 
A quaternion may be used to specify the rotation of one Cartesian
reference frame--sometimes referred to as the base frame or the
&apos;From&apos; frame--into coincidence with a second Cartesian reference
frame--sometimes referred to as the target reference frame or the
&apos;To&apos; frame. Unlike an Euler rotation where three sequential rotations
about primary axes are used, a quaternion rotation is a single
action, specified by a Cartesian vector used as the positive axis of
the rotation (right hand rule) and the magnitude (an angle) of
rotation about that axis.
 
The quaternion may be thought of as defining the instantaneous
orientation--sometimes called &apos;pointing&apos;--of a structure such as an
instrument, antenna, solar array or spacecraft bus, given relative to
a specified reference frame (the base frame), at an epoch of interest.
 
Perhaps of more use is the concept that a quaternion may be used to
rotate an arbitrary Cartesian 3-vector defined in one reference frame
(e.g. an instrument&apos;s reference frame) to an equivalent vector
defined in another reference frame (e.g. the frame tied to a
spacecraft or the J2000 inertial reference frame).
 
A quaternion has four components.  One of the components is a scalar,
a function of the angle of rotation (cosine of half the rotation
angle), while the remaining three components are used to specify a
vector, given in the base reference frame, about which the rotation
will be made. In the PDS context a quaternion has a magnitude of one,
and so may be treated as a unit quaternion.
 
In many cases a time tag (epoch) must be associated with the
quaternion because the orientation varies over time. A time tag is
not needed if the &apos;To&apos; and &apos;From&apos; frames have a fixed offset.
 
The QUATERNION_DESC element is always to be paired with the
QUATERNION element, and will contain a complete description of the
formation and rotational sense of the quaternion specified with the
QUATERNION keyword, and the structure (organization of the four
components) of the quaternion.
 
In the lingo of the NASA &apos;SPICE&apos; ancillary information system a
rotation matrix is synonymous with a C-matrix--that which may be
obtained from a C-kernel. The SPICE Toolkit provides an assortment of
routines that deal with quaternions. The SPICE system also provides
information about specification of reference frames and time tags
suitable for use with quaternions in the SPICE context. The NAIF Node
of the PDS can provide additional documentation on quaternions in a
spacecraft ancillary data context (&apos;Rotations Required Reading&apos; and
&apos;SPICE Quaternion White Paper&apos;).
