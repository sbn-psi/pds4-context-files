The image_id element is used to identify an image and
typically consists of a sequence of characters representing
1) a routinely occurring measure, such as revolution number,
2) a letter identifying the spacecraft, target, or camera,
and 3) a representation of a count within the measure, such
as picture number within a given revolution.
Example:
Mariner 9 - Levanthal Identifier - (orbit, camera, pic #,
            total # of pics in orbit)
Viking Orbiter - (orbit #, sc, pic # (FSC/16)),
Viking Lander - (sc, camera, mars doy, diode (filter),
                 pic # for that day),
Voyager - (pic # for encounter, FDS for cruise)
Note: For Mars Pathfinder, this uniquely identified the observation
parameters of an image. The most significant four digits identified
the command sequence that contained the imaging command. The middle
two digits indicated the version of the command sequence, and the
right four digits identified the image within a single imaging
sequence.
 
If the image_id was even and non-zero, it was a left frame image.
If the image_id was one greater than the left frame image_id (and
therefore odd), it was the right frame of a stereo image. Note
that during operations, a small number of image_ids were re-used
with difference command parameters. This eliminated the uniqueness
of the image_id for those images. The tlm_cmd_discrepancy_flag
may be useful in identifying the images that had this problem.
