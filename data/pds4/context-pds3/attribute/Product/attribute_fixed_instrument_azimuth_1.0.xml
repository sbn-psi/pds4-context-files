The FIXED_INSTRUMENT_AZIMUTH element provides one of two angular
measurements for the pointing direction of an instrument, measured
with respect to a coordinate frame co-linear with the surface fixed
coordinate frame.  The azimuth is measured positively in the
clockwise direction (as viewed from above) with the meridian passing
through the positive spin axis (&apos;north pole&apos;) defining the zero
reference. The angle is measured in the local gravity horizontal
plane, i.e., a plane perpendicular to the local gravity vector.  The
FIXED_INSTRUMENT_AZIMUTH is derived from the instrument pointing and
spacecraft orientation.  It is co-linear with the surface fixed
coordinate system, but the origin of the observation may not be
coincident with the origin of the surface fixed frame.
 
Note that the FIXED_INSTRUMENT_AZIMUTH describes the pointing
direction of the instrument rather than the angular coordinates of
the target of the observation.  If there has been any significant
change over time in the position of the observing instrument (ie.,
the origin of the coordinate frame in which this value is measured),
this data element can not be used to uniquely describe the vector to
a viewed object.  See also FIXED_INSTRUMENT_ELEVATION.
 
This keyword replaces the older SURFACE_BASED_INST_AZIMUTH element,
which should no longer be used.
