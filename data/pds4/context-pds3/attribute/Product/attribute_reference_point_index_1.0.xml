The REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX keyword is used to give the precise
location of a reference point (center of a body, standard star,
coordinate system reference point, etc.) relative to the origin
of the associated object - typically an IMAGE or ARRAY.  The
location is expressed as a sequence of values in units of the
axis index, in the same order as the defined axes.  The indices
for each axis are assumed to be numbered positively from 1.
 
Although the indices are integral, the REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX
values are floating point and may be expressed to an appropriate
level of precision.  For example, if the reference point is the
location of the center of a target body and known to sub-pixel
accuracy, then it may have a REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX value that
looks like: (215.678, 500.234).
 
Note that the reference point is a logical concept, and thus is
not required to be inside the associated object.  If, for example,
the reference point described for an IMAGE object is outside the
field of view included in the IMAGE, the values for
REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX are determined by extrapolation of the image
axes.  In this case some of the REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX values may be
negative or greater than the maximum index found in the image.
 
The REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX as defined here is analogous to the CRPIXn
values of the FITS standard.  Users should note that the CRPIXn
standard is often re-interpreted by data preparers, and should not
assume that any particular CRPIXn set of numbers will map directly
to a valid REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX without first verifying the local
use of the CRPIXn keywords.
 
The REFERENCE_POINT_DESC keyword should be used in conjunction with
REFERENCE_POINT_INDEX to describe the nature of the point being
referenced.
 
See also the REFERENCE_POINT keyword, which locates the reference
point in the physical units of the axes, rather than in index
units (analogous to the FITS CRVALn keywords).
