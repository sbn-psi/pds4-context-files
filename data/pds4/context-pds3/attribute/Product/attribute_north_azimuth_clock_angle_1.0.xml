The north_azimuth_clock_angle element specifies the direction of the
northward pointing azimuth on the surface of the target body as it
appears at the center of an image. It is measured from the &apos;upward&apos;
direction, clockwise to the northward azimuth as projected into the
image plane, assuming the image is displayed as defined by the
SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION elements. This
keyword is intended to be a replacement for the NORTH_AZIMUTH keyword
which has not been used in a consistent way in the past.
Note: In some cases, knowledge of the inertial orientation of the
ratational axis improves with time. This keyword necessarily reflects
the state of knowledge of the rotational axis at the time of preparing
the data product as given by the POLE_DECLINATION and POLE_RIGHT_ASCENSION
elements. Note also that this quantity can vary significantly within a
single image, particularly when a large fraction of the body is
included in the image, so it is sensitive to the accuracy of an image&apos;s
pointing information. This keyword is undefined if the central pixel of
an image does not intersect the target body.
