The INSTRUMENT_ELEVATION element provides the value for the instrument&apos;s
rotation in the vertical direction. It is usually measured from some kind
of low hard stop. Although it may be used for any instrument where it makes
sense, it is primarily intended for use in surface-based instruments that
measure pointing in terms of azimuth and elevation. When in a
DERIVED_GEOMETRY group, defines the elevation (vertical rotation) at which
the instrument is pointed. This value is expressed using the cooridinate
system referred to by REFERENCE_COORD_SYSTEM_NAME and
REFERENCE_COORD_SYSTEM_INDEX contained within the same group. The
interpretation of exactly what part of the instrument is being pointed is
mission-specific. It could be the boresight, the camera head direction, the
CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a number of other things.
As such, for multimission use this value should be used mostly as an
approximation, (e.g., identifying scenes which might contain a given
object).
 
The interpretation for MER is TBD.
