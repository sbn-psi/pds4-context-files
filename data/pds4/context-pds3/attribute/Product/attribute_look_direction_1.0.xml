The value (RIGHT or LEFT) indicates the side of the spacecraft groundtrack
to which the antenna is pointed for data acquired within a synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) image. Most SAR instruments acquire an image on only
one side of the ground track at one time. This value also indicates from
which side the SAR image is illuminated. If the spacecraft images to the
left of its ground track (LOOK_DIRECTION = LEFT), the image will be
illuminated from the (viewer&apos;s) left side, and, conversely, if the
spacecraft looks to the right, the illumination will come from the right in
the image file. The direction of illumination is critical to interpretation
of features in the image.
 
Mosaicked products may contain various combinations of source imagery.
For example, they may combine only left-looking observations
(LOOK_DIRECTION = &apos;LEFT&apos;), only right-looking observations
(LOOK_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;), or a mixture of the two (LOOK_DIRECTION =
{&apos;LEFT&apos;,&apos;RIGHT&apos;}).
Mosaics can also be produced by including or excluding individual pixels
based on the look direction in absolute (ground) coordinates rather than
relative to the spacecraft, e.g. NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST.  With the
SUB_SPACECRAFT_GROUND_AZIMUTH defined as the angle measured clockwise
from the north pole to the sub-spacecraft point at a point on the ground,
values in the range 0 to 180 degrees indicate the spacecraft is to
the east and thus correspond to LOOK_DIRECTION = &apos;WEST&apos;.  Similarly,
azimuths in the range 180 to 360 correspond to EAST, 90 to 270 to NORTH,
and 270 to 360 plus 0 to 90 to SOUTH.
