     The keyword PPI:TIME_FORMAT is used to modify the meaning of the
     keyword-value pair DATA_TYPE = TIME within a data element (COLUMN
     or FIELD). This keyword can only be used in data elements where
     the DATA_TYPE is set to TIME. If the PPI:TIME_FORMAT keyword does
     not appear in the data element object, then DATA_TYPE=TIME will
     have the default interpretation of time in PDS standard time
     format. This keyword may only be used to define alternative time
     formats used in data files. Time values provided in labels and
     catalog files must be in PDS format.
 
     The value assigned to the PPI:TIME_FORMAT keyword is a format
     specification. This specification defines the interpretation of
     every character (alpha, numeric, and non alpha-numeric) included
     in a date/time string. Some characters are interpreted as
     components of the date/time while others are delimiters. Any
     character or group of characters that are interpreted are
     described using a date/time element &apos;token&apos;. The set of valid
     tokens forms a standard value set, described below. The format
     specification describes the parsing algorithm for the date/time
     string of the length BYTES (not including any quotes) from left
     to right.
 
     PPI:TIME_FORMAT may not be used to describe times which are
     defined relative to some reference time or epoch (e.g. Julian
     Date). As a result, times defined relative to some epoch must
     be declared as having some DATA_TYPE other than &apos;TIME&apos;.
 
     Each of the tokens are described as follows:
 
        %YEAR% is the four-digit integer year token (length = 4).
 
        %YR% is the two-digit integer year token. Values greater then
        50 are referenced to 1900 and values less or equal to 50 are
        referenced to 2000 (length = 2).
 
        %YEARBC% is the four-digit integer year BC token (length = 2).
 
        %FYEAR% is the generic fractional year token. There can be any
        number of digits before the decimal point, however, four should
        be sufficient for most data sets. If less than 4 digits precede
        the decimal point, leading zeros are implied. FYEAR is
        referenced to 0001 AD for positive values and negative values
        indicate years BC.
 
        %MM% is the two-digit integer month token. Valid range is 1-12
        (length = 2).
 
        %MON% is the three character month abbreviation token from the
        set {JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV,
        DEC}. The set is not case sensitive so that Jan = jan = JAN
        (length=3).
 
        %MONTH% is the full month name (English) token where month is
        from the set {January, February, March, April, May, June, July,
        August, September, October, November, December}. The month
        value is not case sensitive so that May = may = MAY (length =
        3-8).
 
        %DD% is the two-digit integer day of month token. Valid range
        is 1-31 (length = 2).
 
        %DOY% is a three-digit integer day of year token where Jan 1 =
        001. Valid range is 1-366 (length=3)
 
        %DOY0% is a three-digit integer day of year token where Jan 1 =
        000. If less than three digits are found then leading zero&apos;s
        are implied. Valid range is 0-365 (length = 3).
 
        %FDAY% is the generic fractional day token. The field is
        terminated by a non-numeric character when the column BYTES is
        reached. FDAY can be either floating point or integer and can
        be either positive or negative. The start (FDAY=0.0) date/time
        for the generic FDAY counter is specified by a year elsewhere
        in the TIME_FORMAT string.
 
        %HR% is the two digit integer hour of day token. If only one
        digit is found, then a leading zero is implied. Valid range is
        0-23 (length = 2).
 
        %FHR% is the generic fractional hour token. The field is
        terminated by a non-numeric character or when the column BYTES
        is reached. FHR can be either floating point or integer and can
        be either positive or negative. The start date/time for the
        generic FHR is set elsewhere in the TIME_FORMAT string by the
        next largest time element token.
 
        %MIN% is the two-digit integer minute of hour token. If only
        one digit is found, then a leading zero is implied. Valid range
        is 0-59 (length = 2).
 
        %FMIN% is the generic fractional minute token. The field is
        terminated by a non-numeric character or when the column BYTES
        is reached. FMIN can be either floating point or integer and can
        be either positive or negative. The start date/time for the
        generic FMIN is set elsewhere in the TIME_FORMAT string by the
        next largest time element token.
 
        %SEC% is the two-digit second of minute token. If only one digit
        is found, then a leading zero is implied. The valid range is 0-
        60 (length = 2).
 
        %FSEC% is the generic fractional second token. The field is
        terminated by a non-numeric character or when the column BYTES
        is reached. FSEC can be either floating point or integer and can
        be either positive or negative. The start date/time for the
        generic FSEC is set by the next largest time element token in
        the TIME_FORMAT string.
 
        %MSEC% is the three-digit integer millisecond of second token.
        If less than 3 digits are found, the leading zeros are implied.
        The valid range is 0-999 (length = 3).
 
        %FMSEC% is the generic fractional millisecond token. The field
        is terminated by a non-numeric character or when the column
        BYTES is reached. FMSEC can be either floating point or integer
        and can be either positive or negative. The start date/time for
        the generic FMSEC is set by the next largest time element token
        in the TIME_FORMAT string.

        %MON% is the three character month abbreviation token from the
        set {JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV,

        (length=3).
 
        %MONTH% is the full month name (English) token where month is
        from the set {January, February, March, April, May, June, July,

        %FDAY% is the generic fractional day token. The field is
        terminated by a non-numeric character when the column BYTES is
        reached. FDAY can be either floating point or integer and can
        be either positive or negative. The start (FDAY=0.0) date/time
        for the generic FDAY counter is specified by a year elsewhere
