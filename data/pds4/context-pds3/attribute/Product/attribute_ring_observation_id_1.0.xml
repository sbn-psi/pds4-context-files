 The ring observation id uniquely identifies a single experiment or
observation (image, occultation profile, spectrum, etc.) within a
rings-related data set.  This is the common id by which data are
identified within the Rings Node catalog.  It describes the smallest
quantity of data that can be usefully cataloged or analyzed by itself.
Note that a single observation may be associated with multiple data
products (e.g. raw and calibrated versions of an image).  Note also
that a single data product may be associated with multiple observations
(e.g. a single WFPC2 image file containing four different images).  A
ring observation id is constructed as follows:
p/type/host/inst/time/... where p is a single-letter planet id (one of
J, S, U, or N); type is IMG for images, OCC for occultation profile,
etc.; host is the instrument host id, inst is the instrument id; time
is the observation time as a date or instrument clock count; further
information identifying the observation can then be appended as
appropriate.
