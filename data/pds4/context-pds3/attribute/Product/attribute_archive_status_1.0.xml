The ARCHIVE_STATUS element indicates the stage to which a data set has
progressed in the archiving process, from &apos;IN QUEUE&apos; through &apos;ARCHIVED&apos;.
It can also take on the values &apos;SUPERSEDED&apos; or &apos;SAFED&apos;, which indicate
that the data set is not part of the active archive.  &apos;ACCUMULATING&apos; can be
appended to some values to indicate that the data set is incomplete and/or
that not all components have reached the stage given by the root value;
&apos;ACCUMULATING&apos; would be used, for example, when the archive is being
delivered incrementally, as from a mission that lasts many months or years.
See below for standard values and their definitions.
 
The ARCHIVE_STATUS_NOTE element is available to describe the archive status
in more detail.
 
STANDARD VALUES
 
IN QUEUE - Received at the curation node but no action has been taken by
the curation node. Use with caution.
 
PRE PEER REVIEW - Being prepared for peer review under the direction of the
curation node. Use with caution
 
IN PEER REVIEW - Under peer review at the curation node but evaluation is
not complete. Use with caution
 
IN LIEN RESOLUTION - Peer review completed. Liens are in the process of
being resolved.  Use with caution.
 
LOCALLY ARCHIVED - Passed peer review with all liens resolved. Considered
archived by the curation node but awaiting completion of the standard
archiving process. Possible TBD items include the arrival of thearchive
volume at NSSDC and ingestion of catalog information into the Data Set
Catalog.
 
ARCHIVED - Passed peer review with all liens resolved. Available through
the Data Set Catalog and at NSSDC.
 
IN QUEUE - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are IN QUEUE, but
other parts have not yet been delivered to PDS.  Use with caution.
 
PRE PEER REVIEW - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are in
PRE PEER REVIEW, but other parts are IN QUEUE and/or have not yet been
delivered to PDS. Use with caution.
 
IN PEER REVIEW - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are IN PEER
REVIEW, but other parts are in earlier stages of the archiving process
and/or have not yet been delivered to PDS.  Use with caution.
 
IN LIEN RESOLUTION - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are IN LIEN
RESOLUTION, but other parts are in earlier stages of the archiving process
and/or have not yet been delivered to PDS.  Use with caution.
 
LOCALLY ARCHIVED - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are LOCALLY
ARCHIVED, but other parts are in earlier stages of the archiving process
and/or have not yet been delivered to PDS.  Use with caution.
 
ARCHIVED - ACCUMULATING - Some parts of the data set are ARCHIVED,
but other parts are in earlier stages of the archiving process and/or
have not yet been delivered to PDS.  Use with caution.
 
SUPERSEDED - This data set has been replaced by a newer version, implying
that the data set is not to be used unless the requester has specific
reasons. When a data set has been superseded the Engineering Node, will
notify NSSDC that their databases need to be updated to advise users of
the new status and the location of the replacement data set.
 
SAFED - The data set has been received by the PDS with no evaluation.
Data will not be formally archived.
