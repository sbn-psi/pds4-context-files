This keyword describes the type of measurement contained in a CRISM EDR
or other data product, and provides indication of how the observation
is commanded. The format of the value is AC### where AC is a 2-letter
designation of the type of measurement made, and ### is a 3-numeral
designation of the instrument command macro that was executed to acquire
the data. Macro numbers are in the range 0-255.
 
For EDRs, BI is measurement of detector bias, DF is a measurement of
background including dark current and thermal background, LP is
measurement of a focal plane lamp, SP is measurement of the internal
integrating sphere, and SC is measurement of an external scene. TP
indicates that the EDR contains any test pattern produced by instrument
electronics. T1 through T7 specify the test pattern, test pattern 1
through test pattern 7. UN indicates that the EDR contains data in
which housekeeping does not match the commanded instrument
configuration.
 
For an RDR, RA indicates that the file contains values in units of
radiance (W m^-2 nm^-1 sr^-1). IF indicates that the file contains
values in units of I/F, or radiance divided by solar flux scaled for
heliocentric distance.  AL indicates that the file contains values as
estimated Labert albedo, which is I/F corrected for cosine of incidence
angle and for atmospheric and thermal effects.  SU indicates that the
files contains summary parameters, unitless values derived from Lambert
albedo.
 
For an RDR or a DDR, DE indicates that the files contains derived values
related to observation geometry or independently characterized
properties of the scene.
