      The BROWSE_USAGE_TYPE keyword defines whether a browse product is
      intended to be the primary browse product for an associated data
      product, or is a secondary browse product, for cases when there are
      multiple browse products per data product.
 
      A value of PRIMARY indicates that the browse product is the main
      browse product for a given data product. A value of OVERVIEW indicates
      that a browse product is associated with, or constructed from, several
      data products (e.g. a mosaic or map produced from several image data
      products). A value of SECONDARY indicates
      that the browse product is a supplementary browse product for a data
      product. Choice of which of several browse products is selected as
      PRIMARY is at the discretion of the data provider (subject to peer
      review); rationale for the selection could be documented in the
      label DESCRIPTION of the browse product. SECONDARY browse
      products cannot exist without a PRIMARY product.
 
      The keyword is an optional keyword that can be included in the label
      for a browse product along with the keyword SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID to
      identify the data product. The value of BROWSE_USAGE_TYPE along with
      the value of SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID could be used in user interfaces to
      display browse products resulting from a search or to help users
      understand the relationships between browse products when there is
      more than one browse product for a given source data product.
