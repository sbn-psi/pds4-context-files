The LOCAL_TRUE_SOLAR_TIME element describes the local true solar time, or
LTST.  It is one of two types of solar time used to express the time of day
at a point on the surface of a planetary body. LTST is measured relative to
the true position of the Sun as seen from a point on the planet&apos;s surface.
The coordinate system used to define LTST has its origin at the center of
the planet. Its Zaxis is the north pole vector (or spin axis) of the
planet. The X-axis is chosen to point in the direction of the vernal
equinox of the planet&apos;s orbit. (The vernal or autumnal equinox vectors are
found by searching the planetary ephemeris for those times when the vector
from the planet&apos;s center to the Sun is perpendicular to the planet&apos;s north
pole vector. The vernal equinox is the time when the Sun appears to rise
above the planet&apos;s equator.) Positions of points in this frame can be
expressed as a radius and areocentric &apos;right ascension&apos; and &apos;declination&apos;
angles. The areocentric right ascension angle, or ARA, is measured positive
eastward in the equatorial plane from the vernal equinox vector to the
intersection of the meridian containing the point with the equator.
Similarly, the areocentric declination is the angle between the equatorial
plane and the vector to the point. LTST is a function of the difference
between the ARAs of the vectors to the Sun and to the point on the planet&apos;s
surface. Specifically, LTST = (a(P) - a(TS)) * (24 / 360) + 12 where, LTST
= the local true solar time in true solar hours a(P) = ARA of the point on
the planet&apos;s surface in deg a(TS) = ARA of the true sun in degThe
conversion factor of 24/360 is applied to transform the angular measure in
decimal degrees into hours-minutes-seconds of arc. This standard
representation divides 360 degrees into 24 hours, each hour into 60
minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds of arc. The hours, minutes, and
seconds of arc are called &apos;true solar&apos; hours, minutes, and seconds when
used to measure LTST. The constant offset of 12 hours is added to the
difference in ARAs to place local noon (12:00:00 in hours, minutes,
seconds) at the point where the Sun is directly overhead; at this time, the
ARA of the true sun is the same as that of the surface point so that a(P) -
a(TS) = 0. The use of &apos;true solar&apos; time units can be extended to define a
true solar day as 24 true solar hours. Due to the eccentricity of planetary
orbits and the inclination of orbital planes to equatorial planes
(obliquity), the Sun does not move at a uniform rate over the course of a
planetary year. Consequently, the number of SI seconds in a true solar day,
hour, minute or second is not constant. See also LOCAL_MEAN_SOLAR_TIME.

MPF_LOCAL_TIME, which should no longer be used.
