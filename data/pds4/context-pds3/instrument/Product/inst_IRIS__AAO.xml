Instrument Overview
===================
 
IRIS is a camera and low-resolution spectrograph for the wavelength
range 1.0-2.5 microns.  It was designed and constructed at AAO.  The
detector is a 128x128 pixel format mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe)
NICMOS2 array with 60 micron pixels. The detector is housed in a large
dewar and operated at a constant temperature between 80 and 82 K.  It
is cooled using a closed-cycle compressed helium pump.
 
IRIS mounts at the Cassegrain focus and can be fed either at f/15 or
with the f/36 chopping secondary.  Swapping between these two f/ratios
requires a top-end change.  The chopping secondary is not
driven, and is merely used to provide a convenient f/ratio.
 
The following options are available:
 
f/15 imaging, 1.94 arcsec pixels
f/15 imaging, 0.61 arcsec pixels
f/15 grism long-slit spectroscopy, H window, resolution 300
f/15 grism long-slit spectroscopy, 2.0-2.4 microns, resolution 300
 
f/36 imaging, 0.79 arcsec pixels
f/36 imaging, 0.27 arcsec pixels
f/36 echelle spectroscopy, 0.9-1.5 microns, resolution 400
f/36 echelle spectroscopy, 1.4-2.5 microns, resolution 400
f/36 grism long-slit spectroscopy, 1.2-2.1 microns, resolution 100
 
The following filters are currently provided:
 
Standard broad band J, H, K (1.25, 1.65, 2.2 microns)
Broad-band K&apos; (1.9-2.3 microns)
Narrower Kn filter (2.0-2.3 microns)
1bandpass 1.08 (He I)
1bandpass 1.64 ([Fe II], Galaxy)
1bandpass 1.65 ([Fe II], at 0.002&lt;z&lt;0.006)
1bandpass 2.12 (H2 1-&gt;0 S(1))
1bandpass 2.16 (Brackett gamma)
1bandpass 2.25 (H2 2-&gt;1 S(1))
4bandpass 2.21 (continuum)
4bandpass 2.34 (CO/continuum)
 
The K&apos; filter was defined by Wainscoat &amp; Cowie (1992 Astron J. 103,
332).  The sky background is lowered by a factor of about 3 and the star
signal is typically 92% that at K.  The Kn filter has almost as high
sensitivity, and greatly reduces the effect of water vapour at the short
end of the K&apos; filter. There is some fringing with the [Fe II] filters,
but it appears to cancel when the sky is removed.
 
There is no shutter in IRIS.  For the full array the minimum exposure
is 1.5 seconds.  In summer broad-band K is saturated at f/15 wide, and
at all times of year there is a risk that dome flats cannot be taken in
this configuration.  Standard stars are observed in a smaller window
which can be read in 0.22 seconds.
 
The readout proceeds row by row up the array.  An integration starts
the moment the relevant pixel has been read, so that the first rows are
exposed earlier than the last rows.  The readout noise is about 120
electrons in the most time-efficient mode, and 40 electrons in the
alternative.
 
Scientific Objectives
=====================
 
Being a general user instrument IRIS was developed to be an extremely
versatile camera/spectrograph combination to be useful for a wide range
of astronomical observations.  It has both wide and intermediate field
optics, providing a total of four separate imaging scales, and can
switch in a matter of seconds between slit spectroscopy and imaging
with a choice of two image scales. In the wide field mode it is used as
a survey instrument and to map extended objects such as the central
region of our galaxy, star-formation regions and nearby galaxies.  The
smaller image scales are used for detailed work including mapping
planetary surfaces and atmospheres, studies of the nuclei of galaxies,
and supernovae observations.  The spectroscopic capability allows
determination of redshifts, remote sensing of planetary atmospheres and
compositional studies of stars and galaxies.
 
Calibration
===========
 
Several methods have been used in an attempt to calibrate the SL9 data.
These are: photometric standard stars, polar haze, and Jovian
satellites.  The photometric standard stars were used to calibrate the
imaging data, and the polar haze and satellites were used to calibrate
the spectral mapping data.
 
Detectors
=========
 
The detector is a hybrid array of 128x128 pixel format with 60 micron
pixels.  The IR-sensitive material, mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe),
is bonded to a silicon multiplexer by individual indium columns.  The
array was manufactured by the Rockwell International Science Center of
Thousand Oaks, California, and it would be appreciated if this fact
were mentioned in all publications based on IRIS data.
 
Filters are used to limit the wavelength sensitivity of the detector to
radiation longward of 0.8 microns (otherwise the silicon multiplexer
will continue to detect bright objects throughout the visible range).
The detector is tuned to cut-off at 2.5 microns on the longward end.
 
The hybrid nature of the chip ensures that the idiosyncracies of each
part are compounded.  The detector displays the following
characteristics:
 
i)    A bias level that differs for the three readout methods and totally
      dominates most data.
ii)   A dark current caused by the chip and by stray radiation inside the
      IRIS dewar, which therefore depends on the dewar configuration.
iii)  Wavelength-dependent fixed pattern noise, both coarse (ripples across
      the chip with a typical wavelength of 40 pixels) and fine (at short
      wavelength, individual hotter and cooler pixels).
iv)   Dead and permanently bright pixels (failures in the indium columns
      etc).
v)    Vertical striping caused by the architecture of the silicon
      multiplexer.
vi)   Sectors of circular arcs with a common centre off the chip to lower
      right, attributed to growth effects in the doped silicon; known to
      the cognoscenti as the silicon swirl.
vii)  Bright or dark splotches about 3 pixels across and &lt;1 amplitude in
      flat-fielded data.
viii) Nonlinearities that become particularly serious around 60000 ADU, or
      20000-30000 above bias.
 
The procedures for removing all these effects are now standard, though
there still seem to be occasions when not everything is cleaned out
adequately. Dark and/or bias subtraction is used to remove (i) and (ii),
after which (viii) is removed by a simple linearity correction as used
in optical CCDs, while (iii), (v) and (vi) flat field out using a
wavelength-matched observation of a continuum source.  The bad pixels
[(iv)] can only be tolerated and replaced by interpolation with the
surrounding pixels, as necessary.  The detector originally displayed 70
bad pixels, but this number has steadily been increasing with the age of
the detector.
 
A very bright star that saturates the detector does not bleed along rows
or columns; the excess electrons recombine harmlessly.  However, you may
see a slight brightening along rows that pass through it.  Similar
streaks passing through saturated bad pixels are seen on dark frames.
 
The remnance is acceptably good.  Highly oversaturated images fade from
significance in a minute or two.  There is a long tail to the remnance,
however, so that long dark exposures taken even half an hour later can
show a weak afterimage.
 
Electronics
===========
 
The chip is slow to read out.  To read and reset every pixel requires
nearly 1.5 sec; to read and not reset requires 0.9.  The readout
proceeds row by row up the array.  An integration starts the moment the
relevant pixel has been read, so that the first rows are exposed
earlier than the last rows. There are 9.5 electrons per ADU.
 
There are three ways of reading out the array, and they have different
uses.  Method 1 was used for the SL9 data.  In method 1 the incoming
charge accumulates for the exposure time, after which it is read and
each well is reset to the bias level.  This is the end read, Er.
Method 1 is normally suggested for broad-band imaging, or situations in
which the expected count rate is high, because the readout noise for
this mode is high (~120 e-).  However, it is the most efficient readout
because there is scarcely any dead time between reading a pixel and
readying it to accept more photons (there are other dead times in the
system, at the start and end of exposures when processing and writing
to disk occur).
 
Once read out from the detector, IRIS data are stored temporarily in
the external memory (XMEM) unit, where they may be manipulated before
finally being sent to disk.  Normal processing takes the form of
coadding various cycles of an observation and median filtering to
remove cosmic rays and other transient events present on only one
exposure.  For the SL9 data no such intermediate processing or coadding
was performed.  Instead, in drift-scanning mode successive exposures
were stacked in the XMEM as a cube as the telescope was scanned, and
the entire cube was dumped at the end of the scan.
 
Location
========
 
        Latitude:   031o 16&apos; 37.344&apos;&apos;S       (31.27704 degrees S)
        Longitude:  149o 03&apos; 57.960&apos;&apos;E      (149.06610 degrees E)
        Altitude:   1164 meters
 
Operational Modes
=================
 
Operational modes used:  imaging,  slit spectroscopy, and spectral
mapping.  The spectral mapping is done by taking spectra using a slit
across the target object and then moving the slit to take the next
spectrum.  Effectively the telescope is scanned perpendicular to the
slit direction, while IRIS records spectra at each of a number of
positions.  The number of frames taken is thus the number of positions
required along the scan line, or a multiple thereof for multiple passes
(for the IRIS SL9 data we typically used 153 cycles, or scan positions,
comprising 2 passes across the planet).  The scan direction corresponds
to the z-axis in the output data cube. Consequently increasing pixel
number on the z-axis also corresponds to increasing time since the start
of the scan.
 
The resulting data cube will have as the other spatial dimensions the
128 columns of the chip in the spectral (x) direction (unless windowed
smaller - although windowing this axis, i.e. cutting down on the
recorded spectral range, is VERY rare) and the 128 rows that include
spatial information along the length of slit used (y-axis). Some of our
data are windowed in y, however, so the full 128 pixels may not have
been used.  This form of windowing is normally done to reduce the
readout time of the chip and avoid saturation on bright objects (like
the impacts!).  When cutting the data cube, an image of the scanned
planet will be found in the yzplane.  For every pixel in that yzplane
image, a spectra will have been recorded in the x direction. Conversely,
the xyplane contains a series of spectra with spatial information (along
the slit, i.e. a slice of the planet) in the y direction.
 
Measured Parameters
===================
 
The instrument actually measures the brightness of the area of the sky
the telescope is pointed to in a specific wavelength region for
imaging, and for a wide range of wavelengths for spectroscopy and
spectral mapping.  The imaging uses a bandpass filter to only capture
the specific wavelength range desired (example:  2.34um Methane band
filter used for N and V imaging).  The spectra are created by passing
the light from the target through a grism (a grating etched prism)
which differentiates the incoming light into its component
wavelengths.
