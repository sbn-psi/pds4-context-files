    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter was observed by
      using OASIS (Okayama Astrophysical System for Infrared Imaging and
      Spectroscopy) at cassegrain focus of the 188-cm telescope of Okayama
      Astrophysical Observatory (OAO), which is a branch of National
      Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAO).
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
      To observe the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter by
      using OASIS (Okayama Astrophysical System for Infrared Imaging and
      Spectroscopy) at cassegrain focus of the 188-cm telescope of OAO.
 
 
    Calibration
    ===========
      The impact of fragment K was predicted at 10h18m UT, July 19, 1994.
      We used a filter with centered wavelength of 2.35 micron (FWHM 0.05
      micron) to take images continuously. In each frame, Jupiter and two
      Galilean satellites, Io (left) and Ganymede (right), were seen. We
      used Io as a flux calibrator. Flux from Io was estimated at
      7.8x10^-12 W m^-2 micron^-1.
 
 
    Operational Considerations
    ==========================
      The integration time occasionally varied due to some instability of
      the control system of the OASIS. Each image was bias subtracted,
      flat fielded and corrected for bad pixels. The top of each frame is
      north.  These observations caught two precursors: the main event and
      the shoulder of the K impact. We used two ND filters, whose
      transparencies are 10% and 2%, to prevent the OASIS from saturation
      due to the brighter main event.
 
 
    Detectors
    =========
      The OASIS is a 256 x 256 NICMOS3 (HgCdTe) array. One pixel of the
      OASIS corresponds to 1.0 arcsec.  This infrared camera allows
      imaging from 1-2.5 micron with a high dynamic range.   The pixel
      size is 40 micron.

       1.50 (ammonia band)
       others (continuum)
 
 
    Field of View
    =============
      View of the OASIS is 4.3 arcmin x 4.3 arcmin, covered by 256 x 256
      NICMOS3 (HgCdTe) array. One pixel of the OASIS corresponds to 1.0
      arcsec. The OASIS was at final stage of its making for the SL9
      impact.
