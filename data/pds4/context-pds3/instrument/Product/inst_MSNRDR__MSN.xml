    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    The disintegration of a meteoroid in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere
    produces light and ionization, both of which have a complex
    relation to the energy (mass and velocity) of the particle.
    A meteor trail can reflect radio waves, producing &apos;echoes&apos;
    having measurable parameters such as amplitude and duration
    which can be related to the properties and energy of the
    particle. Some radars are able to determine meteor velocity.
 
         The luminous meteor is a point source moving with
    sufficiently high angular velocity that the human eye is a
    more sensitive detector than typical lenses and photographic
    emulsions. However, the eye is not a particularly
    satisfactory quantitative recorder of brightness and
    position. The current sensitivity of electronic imaging
    devices much exceeds that of the human eye.
 
         In order to cover as wide a mass range of meteors as
    possible, a variety of ground-based techniques is required.
    The resulting data are of many types and in many formats. In
    general the data occur in two basic forms -- statistical
    counts and single events. It was established that all
    statistical counts would be for one-hour intervals. These
    observations range from a simple count of meteors seen, to
    diversified radar echo counts in multiple interval classes
    of range (distance) and/or echo duration or echo amplitude.
 
         It was stressed to all observers that it was important
    to distinguish carefully between meteors belonging to the
    Halley showers and those that are background or other shower
    meteors. Shower counts are at best slightly higher than
    background counts. Some radars are able to distinguish on
    the basis of velocity and/or the geometry of the trail, but
    for others, shower counts are obtained only by subtraction
    of an assumed background rate.
 
         It was required that radar meteor echo counts be made
    in standardized class intervals of echo duration and
    amplitude.
 
         Major activity takes place at solar longitudes 42.5-47
    deg (May 3-8) for the Eta Aquarid shower and 206-210 deg
    (October 19-24). At least two other relatively stable
    secondary maxima have been observed in both showers. They
    are distinctly separated from the main zones at longitudes
    38 deg and 50 deg (April 28/29 and May 10/11) and at 203 deg
    and 215 deg (October 16/17 and 28/29). The maximum at the
    beginning of each shower is of particular interest since it
    is thought to contain particles of most recent vintage.
 
         As noted earlier, activity extends over as much as
    fourteen days--between solar longitudes 37 and 51 deg (April
    27-May 11) and between 202 and 216 deg (October 15-30), with
    priority given to the central interval. The lunar phase is
    significant for visual observations and was reasonably good
    for the two years: the new moon occurred on 1985 28 October
    and 1986 9 May.
 
         The suite of data that has been archived consists of
    radar meteor counts and visual observations. The radar
    stations which provided data are listed in Meteor Studies
    Network chapter of &apos;The Comet Halley Archive Summary Volume
    &apos; (Sekanina, Z., 1991). They range from latitude +54 deg to
    -33 deg, longitude 75 deg W (285 deg) to 69 deg E.
    Observations of both the Eta Aquarid and Orionid meteor
    showers from 1984 through 1988 are included-- a total of
    5662 hours of data.

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         Meteor observations are specifically oriented toward
    studies of comet-meteor relationships. They contribute to
    comet science mainly in the areas of dust production and
    the dust-particle dynamics. These aspects can be enhanced by:
 
         o determination of the number density and mass
            distribution of particles in the showers,
 
         o determination of the properties and composition of
            the particles,
 
         o study of the evolution of the Halley meteor stream,
 
         o study of the spatial structure of the stream,
            especially as a function of particle mass.
 
         The IHW program provided an opportunity to coordinate
    and combine many different observations to determine the
    stream structure with high resolution and to infer from this
    the production and dynamical evolution of the larger dust
    particles.
 
         This goal is independent of the current comet passage.
    No increase in normal meteor shower rates was expected, and
    none was observed. It was thought that the more rapid and
    wider dispersal of fine particles might contribute fresh
    meteors observable on sensitive instruments. These were
    searched for with the Canadian High-Power Meteor Radar,
    particularly at the time of the Earth&apos;s passage through the
    comet orbit plane, but results were negative.
 
         The Earth makes two close approaches to the comet
    orbit, once in early May, and again in late October. In
    common with other comet-produced meteor streams, the dust
    ejected from Halley is dispersed along the orbit and
    laterally from the orbit; but, uncommonly in meteor
    astronomy, the Earth passes twice every year through the
    band of Halley particles, thus producing the long-known
    Eta-Aquarid (May) and Orionid (October) meteor showers. Most
    of the meteor activity is confined to a period of about five
    days in each case. However, this period is not well defined;
    shower meteors have been observed over as long as fourteen
    days. Furthermore the activity is not consistent from year
    to year -- the position in time of maximum flux shifts
    significantly and there are secondary maxima. Hence an
    activity curve for one year is not a reliable predictor for
    the activity in another year. If averaged over many years, a
    broad flat curve results, which again is not indicative of
    annual activity.
 
         Traditional visual observations have never been carried
    out over sufficiently long intervals of time to define
    clearly the structure of the stream. Radar observations have
    contributed to our understanding of the structure, but they
    are also not without problems. A paper by Hajduk (1970)
    summarizes visual and radar observations from 1900 to 1969.
    There are also some earlier, medieval and ancient
    observations.
 
         The geometric relation between the Earth&apos;s orbit and
    the comet&apos;s current orbit suggests that the two showers
    should not be of equal strength or equal duration, which is
    contrary to actual observations. A recent theory (McIntosh
    and Hajduk 1983; McIntosh and Jones 1988) proposes that the
    long-term evolution of comet and dust results in a flat
    ribbon of particles so that the Earth&apos;s two crossings yield
    approximately equal-activity, equal-duration showers.
 
         Observationally the meteors are very fast (V &gt; 65 km/s
    for both showers), with persistent trains being common.
    Studies of the physical characteristics and composition of
    the particles are sparse, but there is no evidence that they
    are unusual.
 
         The visual rates for the showers may be as high as 30
    per hour depending on the latitude of the observer. The
    low-declination radiant of the May shower (in Aquarius, at
    R.A. = 335.5 deg, Dec = -1.9 deg) rises only a little before
    sunrise, particularly at high northern latitudes, providing
    a very limited period for visual or optical observations.
    More extensive coverage by Southern Hemisphere observers was
    needed.
 
         The observing period for the Orionids extends through
    nearly the entire night because of the radiant&apos;s much
    greater elongation from the Sun (R.A. = 94.5 deg, Dec =
    +15.8 deg). The higher declination and time of the year
    favor Northern Hemisphere observers.
 
         Studies benefit also from observations at many
    longitudes around the Earth. This is true of the
    Eta-Aquarids in particular.
