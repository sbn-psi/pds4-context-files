  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The following information was taken from the Lick Observatory
    web site, http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/ on July 20, 2003.
 
    The Stover CCD Spectrograph/Camera at the Nickel Telescope is a
    modular instrument which may be configured in a variety of ways.
    The basic choice is to use it as a spectrograph or as a camera. In
    either mode, the throughput is quite high, but absorption in the
    CCD camera lens cuts off the UV response below ~3850 Angstroms and
    the IR above ~8000 Angstroms.
 
    The spectrograph is a straight-through design . After passing
    through the slit aperture and the filter wheel, the light passes
    through the shutter and then through a collimating lens about
    midway down the body of the spectrograph. Traveling a roughly
    equal distance again, the collimated beam is dispersed by one of
    three remotely selected grisms (transmission gratings cemented to
    prisms), and then focused onto the CCD by the camera lens. Between
    the camera and the CCD is a manually operated dark slide, which is
    routinely rediscovered by many observers on the first night of
    each run. The CCD and its dewar are mounted on an x-y stage which
    allows choice of central wavelength and position of the spectrum
    on the CCD.
 
    A variety of direct camera configurations are available which are
    described in detail later, but their configurations are all
    conceptually variants of the spectrograph without the dispersers.
 
    It is most unfortunate that one may not conveniently switch
    between spectroscopy and imaging. This is because the TV camera
    may not be offset, and spectroscopic guiding is done directly on
    the aluminized aperture plates, so if they are removed to allow a
    two dimensional image to fall on the CCD then guiding is no longer
    possible. If it is enough for you to have just an unguided
    snapshot of a field, that may be done.
 
    The spectrograph/camera is controlled remotely from the readout
    room. At present, the only functions that cannot be controlled
    remotely are the manual darkslide and movement of the x-y stage in
    the y direction, perpendicular to dispersion. These are very
    small inconveniences, since the y stage setting usually stays
    constant during a given run, and the dark slide is usually only
    changed at the beginning and end of the night. Thus, the observer
    generally does not need to go onto the dome floor at night, but
    makes all required adjustments remotely.
 
    Data taking and preliminary analysis is done from two terminals in
    the control room. The data taking process is a menu driven system,
    which most observers find to be extraodinarly user-friendly.
 
 
  Location
  ========
    The observatory location data given here are geodetic latitude and
    east longitude, based on values from the Astronomical Almanac,
    1989. The geocentric site radius was determined using the MERIT
    1983 earth figure, equatorial radius = 6378.137 km and flattening
    of the reference spheroid = 1/298.257.
 
    Latitude:                       37.343  Degrees
    Longitude:                    -121.637  Degrees
    Earth radius at observatory:    6371.6  Kilometers
