    INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION
    ======================
 
 
      These data are molecular (spectral line-SL) observations.
      These data are archived in FITS format as one-dimensional
      spectra of the flux density of the comet as a function of the
      line of sight velocity.  For most SL observations, the line of
      sight velocity is given with respect to the observer, although
      some observers transmitted their results to us in terms of the
      geocentric velocity.
 
      Some SL observations were conducted using two receivers having
      orthogonal polarizations.  In order to preserve this
      information, we have presented the polarized spectral data in a
      two dimensional format with a second axis to designate which
      polarization applies.  These spectra will have the NAXIS
      keyword set equal to 2, and the second axis will be labeled
      either &apos; CIRCULAR POLARIZATION&apos; or &apos;LINEAR POLARIZATION&apos;.  This
      method for designationg polarization is similar to the
      convention used in many FITS formats, where a seperate axis
      (often labeled &apos;STOKES&apos;) is used to give the full Stokes
      parameters of the data.  However, full Stokes parameters have
      not measured in this archive, and so we have defined these new
      polarization axes to handle this situation.

    SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES
    =====================
 
      Radio Astronomy is a developing new technique for the study of
      comets.  In some areas, such as observations of the OH radical
      via its 18 cm transitions, the observational procedures and
      analysis are well developed.  Studies in these areas have
      proved their value since they both provide new probes of
      important physical processes as well as a window on physical
      processes which are less well known and less accessible to
      study by other techniques.  In many other areas, however, the
      study of comets at radio wavelengths continues to be primarily
      an exploratory endeavor.  In recognition of this fact, the IHW
      Radio Science Discipline Specialist team felt that it was
      important to attempt many different kinds of observations
      during this campaign on Halley&apos;s Comet, since each observation
      has scientific merit as an exploration.  Thus, we have been
      careful to document and include all data submitted to this
      archive by radio observers.
 
      The P/Halley Archive contains data from 36 different observing
      groups, representing a range of techniques.  The majority of
      the observational data come in the well developed area of 18cm
      OH observations.  However, many other projects were attempted
      as well.  Approximately 75% of the groups who are known to have
      obtained useful data on the comet have submitted it to the
      archive, and we are grateful to them for their contributions.
