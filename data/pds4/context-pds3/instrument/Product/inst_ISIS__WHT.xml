  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The information in this document was taken from the website
    www.ing.iac.es/ on June 19, 2001.
 
    The Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System (ISIS)
    was designed and built by the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO)
    and Oxford University in a collaborative effort with the design
    and construction carried out predominantly at the RGO.
 
    Description:  This versatile Cassegrain instrument consists of two
    intermediate dispersion spectrographs which can be operated one at
    a time or simultaneously, and are separately optimized for the
    blue and red spectral regions.
 
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The main goals are to provide:  a range of dispersions between 130
    and 16 angstroms/mm in first order, corresponding to a range in
    resolving power respectively between 800 and 7000 when using a
    narrow (0.5 arcsecond) slitwidth; maximum possible throughput;
    high operating efficiency in both the setting-up and observing
    modes, with the capability of operating the blue and red
    spectrographs as a single unit; rapid interchange between ISIS and
    the Faint Object Spectrograph, which share the same slit assembly;
    long slit (4 arcminute), multi-slit and fibre optic feed
    capabilities; a cross-dispersed mode capable of recording the
    wavelength range from 3000 to 1100 nm with a resolving power of
    about 2000; facilities for spectro-polarimetry; and full
    capability of being remotely operated.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    Local seeing can be degraded by the presence in the atmosphere of
    dust from Sahara dust storms, and by the presence of moisture or
    clouds.
 
 
  Detectors
  =========
 
      Note: Additional information is available in
          DOCUMENT/U_MAN.PDF
 
    The detector in each arm for this data set was a TEK CCD (1k*1k).
 
 
    Blue Arm
    --------
      The CCD used on the blue arm of ISIS was the thinned, AR coated
      chip named TEK1.  It is an array of 1024x1024, 24 micron pixels
      with a pixel scale on the blue arm of 0.33 arcsec/pixel.

  Filters
  =======
   No filter was used for the ISIS blue arm. For the ISIS red arm, the
   GG495 filter was used. The GG495 filter is an order-separation
   filter designed to filter out second order blue from the first
   order red in usual applications. In the case of ISIS, where a
   dichroic splits the beam into red and blue components, it helps
   define the &apos;red&apos; channel short wavelength.  GG495 is a standard
   Schott filter which passes long wavelengths and suppresses short
   wavelengths. According to the Schott catalogue the half-power
   wavelength is 495 +/- 6 nm with &lt; 1.E-5 for wavelengths less than
   450 and &gt; 0.99 for 550 nm with a standard thickness of 3mm.
