  Instrument Overview
  ===================
 
  The following information comes from the ATM website
  (http://atm.wff.nasa.gov/):
 
  &apos;The Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a scanning LIDAR developed and
  used by NASA for observing the Earth&apos;s topography for several scientific
  applications, foremost of which is the measurement of changing arctic and
  antarctic icecaps and glaciers. It typically flies on aircraft at an
  altitude between 400 and 800 meters above ground level, and measures
  topography to an accuracy of ten to twenty centimeters by incorporating
  measurements from GPS (global positioning system) receivers and inertial
  navigation system (INS) attitude sensors.
 
  The current ATM is the latest in a series of instruments that trace their
  history back to the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) project, which was
  conceived in 1975 as an airborne testbed for new applications of laser
  remote sensing. The topographic mapping and ocean fluorosensing functions
  of the AOL were separated in 1994 when the old AOL hardware was replaced by
  two new systems, now known as the ATM and the AOL. The ATM instruments
  commonly fly aboard the NASA P3-B based at Wallops Flight Facility,
  Virginia, and aboard several twin-otter (DHC-6) aircraft. A major task of
  the ATM since 1993 has been the measurement of the Greenland ice sheet with
  the goal of determining changes in the ice sheet elevation. Other uses have
  included verification of satellite altimeters, and the measurement of
  sea-ice thickness. The altimeter often flies in conjunction with other
  instruments, and has been used to measure sea-surface elevation and ocean
  wave characteristics. New applications are always being investigated.&apos;

  information.
