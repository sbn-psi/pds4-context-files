    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    Correspondence indicated the existence of about 4000 images
    that might qualify for the archive, and about 3700 were
    received. Most observers had done a good job of filtering
    out the unusable data, and 3540 images were cataloged and
    reformatted for the archive. Digital CCD images comprise 98%
    of the collection. Many observers, faced with the task of
    flat fielding large numbers of CCD images for the first
    time, submitted images up until the deadline. With the
    exception of 65 photographs digitized at the NNSN Center,
    only reduced data were accepted. It was assumed that the
    observers were the best qualified and equipped properly to
    flat field their images. Improved detectors, more
    telescopes, and dedicated observers overcame the poor
    observing circumstances of Comet Halley&apos;s 1986 apparition to
    obtain some truly remarkable images that show much finer
    detail than the best images taken during the very favorable
    1910 apparition. This, and the fact that there is nearly
    continuous coverage for 2 months both pre- and post-
    perihelion, provides an unprecedented data set for the study
    of near-nucleus phenomena for any comet.
 
         The NNSN data are of uneven quality for many possible
    reasons, and sub- standard images were often included in
    cases when there were no other data. The rationalization for
    including substandard images is that it may be possible,
    with future sophisticated image reconstruction software, to
    compensate for imperfect focus or guiding that currently
    limits the value of these images. It was felt that a
    present-day archivist cannot accurately predict what data
    may be useful in the future as far as the next apparition of
    Comet Halley. In some cases, the images are very weak, but
    these were usually the only narrow- band images available.
    In most cases, information on identified defects is included
    in the header comments.
 
         The Halley Archive contains 3540 NNSN images, which
    range in time from recovery in 1982 through the 1989
    observing season. The number of images is near the middle of
    our range of early estimates. The majority of images (about
    three quarters) were taken from 1985 mid-October through
    1986 May, during the period of major jet activity, when the
    comet was within 2 AU of the Sun. The coverage was excellent
    during the spacecraft encounters. There are some gaps during
    full moon periods pre-perihelion, as well solar conjunction
    1986 January 29 through February 27.
 
         There are no calibration frames included in the
    archive. Calibration information, such as step wedge input
    intensities and output counts, are included in the HISTORY
    or COMMENT lines. In some cases, there might be conversion
    factors from counts to magnitude or flux units. In other
    cases, total counts, times and exposures of standard stars
    are given.
 
         Table I (see below) lists the filters used and their
    wavelengths at 50 percent (and for some also at 10 percent)
    of maximum transmission. These numbers do not take into
    account detector responses or atmospheric extinction. For
    more information on transmission characteristics, the
    observers should be contacted directly (Note: in the table
    below, the broadband I filter response is affected by the
    choice of CCD). There are five general categories of
    filters:
 
         (1) Four standard broadband photometry filters sets are
    not specifically intended to isolate cometary emissions.
    During the period of maximum activity (1986 January-April)
    the dominant source was dust, but the V and B bands have
    sizable contributions from C2 and CN emissions. Some filter
    data were obtained from Thuan and Gunn (1976) and from
    Bessell (1979).
 
         (2) Schott glass filters were used primarily as
    short-wavelength cutoff filters. The table indicates the 10
    percent and 50 percent cutoff wavelengths, while the
    effective peak and the long wavelength cutoffs were defined
    by the detectors.
 
         (3) IHW/IAU cometary filters are imaging quality
    versions of the standard photometry bandpasses. The values
    in the table are the mean of all those measured and are
    correct to 1 nm. Further details can be found in the
    Photometry and Polarimetry Network summary. Our IHW filter
    names are intended to indicate the effective peak
    wavelengths (in nm) and the emissions they should isolate.
    The continuum bands are indicated by BC (blue continuum), MC
    (mid continuum) and RC (red continuum).
 
         (4) Giotto Halley Multicolor Camera filters were used
    to provide ground- based calibration during the flyby. The
    filter characteristics are taken from Keller et al. (1982).
 
         (5) Special bandpass filters are the remaining
    miscellaneous filters that observers usually selected to
    investigate special spectral features. A particularly useful
    example is the 618H2O+, which isolates the (0,8,0) emission
    of H2O+ and provides excellent images of the ion tail.

         Listed below some features of some specific data sets
    that the user should be aware of.
 
         The Wise Observatory polarization images of Eaton
    (402601-21) are broken into separate fields separated by
    blank spaces.
 
         The COMETMAX and SKYMIN values for the images taken
    when Comet Halley was at large heliocentric distances
    (400001-012, 403801-950, 406001-124) are only guideline
    values to produce a good display, since the comet is
    sometimes only a few counts above the background.
 
         The photographs from Mt. Johns Observatory and Cerro El
    Roble (402501- 546, 402551-566) were digitized using an LPL
    CCD camera and macro lens adjusted to give an appropriate
    scale. When there is sensitometric calibration, the
    digitized step values and their relative input intensities
    are given in the header comments. The Cerro El Roble films
    had multiple exposures, so when there are two images per
    field, the time and exposure of the faintest image is given
    in the header comment. The user should be aware that there
    will be two sets of field stars in these images.
 
    Details on the instrument system are given in the table

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         When the International Halley Watch (IHW) was formed,
    cometary near nucleus study was a field with little
    quantitative foundation, based largely on descriptive
    reports of primarily visual observations of coma morphology.
    One of the most extensive of these was Bobrovnikoff&apos;s (1931)
    monograph on the 1910 apparition of Comet Halley. The
    potential of such studies was underscored with the
    publication of the Atlas of Cometary Forms by Rahe et al.
    (1969), which illustrated some of the interesting coma
    patterns in Comet Halley observed over the previous two
    apparitions. The application of modern photographic
    emulsions in recording the spectacular spiral jets in Comet
    Bennett (1970 II) (Larson and Minton, 1972), the analysis of
    expanding haloes to estimate nucleus rotation periods by
    Whipple (1978, 1980), and the quantitative modeling of fans
    and jets by Sekanina (1979, 1981a,b) provided further
    justification for a dedicated network to observe the
    expected changing coma pattern of Comet Halley. From the
    onset it was clear that the NNSN strategy for obtaining data
    would be similar to that of the Large Scale Phenomena
    Network (LSPN), but that details, such as optimum detectors,
    plate scales, temporal coverage, and acquisition of
    telescope time needed to be defined.
 
         In the broadest sense, the goal of near-nucleus studies
    is to understand the processes taking place in the coma as
    they relate to the physical nature of the cometary nucleus.
    Assuming that the observed coma distribution results from
    the ejection of material from a possibly inhomogenous,
    rotating nucleus, coma anisotropy can be used as a tracer of
    nucleus activity and motion. By measuring the motions of
    coma features and extrapolating back to the time of
    ejection, it is possible to locate the active areas on the
    nucleus, and by observing a sufficient number of features
    over time, determine or constrain the nucleus rotational
    motion. Knowledge of the distribution and evolution of
    active areas may provide important clues to the internal
    structure of the nucleus and of the comet formation
    environment. To fulfill these goals for Comet Halley, the
    Near Nucleus Studies Network (NNSN) was designed to obtain
    data on the spatial and temporal distribution of matter in
    the coma at the highest possible resolution, especially
    during the period of maximum activity in 1985-86.
