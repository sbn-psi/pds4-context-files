    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    Many occultation-type experiments were carried out during
    the Halley campaign. Unfortunately, relatively few were
    reported to the International Halley Watch for inclusion in
    this archive. The occultation data that are presented here
    employed the Milky Way itself as a background source and
    made observations of a track across the sky with and without
    the comet present in the beam. When carried out as a
    spectral line experiment, these data result in a two
    dimensional data type with spectra taken at many positions
    along a track on the sky. We have attempted to preserve the
    raw data here by saving these two dimensional images in the
    FITS file. Thus, a typical file contains: (1) the data with
    the comet in the beam; (2) one or more maps with the comet
    out of the beam, which were obtained on a different day. We
    have chosen to present these different maps as a three
    dimensional &apos;cube&apos; of data, with NAXIS = 3. The first axis
    is the frequency dimension of the spectra. The second axis
    is the position of the spectrum in RA. Finally, the third
    axis, labeled &apos;MAP-TYPE&apos; defines which map is being
    presented. MAP-TYPE = 0 is the data with the comet in the
    beam, and MAP-TYPE not equal to 0 gives the map of the
    galactic background alone on one or more days of
    observation. Users are advised to check the individual FITS
    headers for further information on the definition of
    MAP-TYPE for specific dates of observation.
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         Radio Astronomy is a developing new technique for the
    study of comets. In some areas, such as observations of the
    OH radical via its 18 cm transitions, the observational
    procedures and analysis are well developed. Studies in these
    areas have proved their value since they both provide new
    probes of important physical processes as well as a window
    on physical processes which are less well-known and less
    accessible to study by other techniques. In many other areas,
    however, the study of comets at radio wavelengths continues
    to be primarily an exploratory endeavor. In recognition of
    this fact, the IHW Radio Science Discipline Specialist team
    felt that it was important to attempt many different kinds of
    observations during this campaign on Halley&apos;s Comet, since each
    observation has scientific merit as an exploration. Thus, we
    have been careful to document and include all data submitted
    to this archive by radio observers.
 
         The P/Halley Archive contains data from 36 different
    observing groups, representing a range of techniques. The
    majority of the observational data comes in the well
    developed area of 18cm OH observations. However, many other
    projects were attempted as well. Approximately 75% of the
    groups who are known to have obtained useful data on the
    comet have submitted it to the archive, and we are grateful
    to them for their contributions. Instrument Location:
