  Instrument Overview
  ===================
 
  Goniometer
 
  A photometric goniometer measures the reflected light properties of
  surfaces from a variety of illumination and viewing positions. The majority
  of goniometers being used for planetary applications are limited, either by
  design or use, to measurements in the principal (or scattering) plane. The
  Bloomsburg University Goniometer (BUG) instrument was designed to measure
  the scattering properties over the entire upper hemisphere. Additionally,
  it is an automated system that utilizes stepper motors and motion control
  and measurement software. The light source is a 100W
  quartz-tungsten-halogen research grade lamp. The output light is filtered
  using 50nm FWHM interference filters within the visible and near-infrared
  (400-1000 nm range), then chopped and focused into a glass fiber-optic
  bundle. The fiber optic cable terminates at the top of one of the two arms
  (incidence arm) with a collimating lens assembly, where it is then directed
  onto the sample. The source arm is capable of incidence angles of 0-65
  degrees (depending on sample size), and also swivels in azimuth from 0-170
  deg. The reflected light is detected by a silicon-detection system which is
  &apos;locked in&apos; to the chopper, and provides very stable, low noise
  measurements, even in low-level ambient light. The detector is mounted on
  the longer arm (emission arm) and is capable of emission angles of -80 to
  +80 deg. The degree of movement described here allows a complete
  half-hemisphere of scattered light to be measured (including the principal
  plane). For isotropic samples, the other half-hemisphere is theoretically
  the mirror image (across the principal plane) of that measured, and this is
  checked at selected places. The width of the collimating lens and its
  distance from the sample limits the phase angle to a minimum of 3.0 deg
  (the detector is occulted by the optics at smaller phase angles). The
  maximum useful phase angle is 145 deg.
 
  CCD Camera System
 
  For documentation purposes, a Panasonic CCD color video camera is used to
  capture images of the surface. A 10x closeup zoom lens allows the
  field-of-view (FOV) and highest resolution to be controlled. Tests with the
  system show that resolutions as high as 60um are possible (15um pixels) at
  a 1cm FOV.
 
  Spectrograph
 
  A single-grating spectrograph (Oriel Corp. FICS/Linespec system) is also
  available to document the characteristics of each sample. Spectral coverage
  is 400-1000nm with spectral resolutions of ~6nm.
