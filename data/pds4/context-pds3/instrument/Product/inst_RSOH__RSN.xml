    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    The principal type of data is the 18-cm OH observations.
    These data are archived in FITS format as one-dimensional
    spectra of the flux density of the comet as a function of
    the line of sight velocity. For most OH observations, the
    line of sight velocity is given with respect to the
    observer, although some observers transmitted their results
    to us in terms of the geocentric velocity.
 
         Many OH line observations were conducted using two
    receivers having orthogonal polarizations. In order to
    preserve this information, we have presented the polarized
    spectral data in a two dimensional format with a second axis
    to designate which polarization applies. These spectra will
    have the NAXIS keyword set equal to 2, and the second axis
    will be labeled either &apos;CIRCULAR POLARIZATION&apos; or &apos;LINEAR
    POLARIZATION&apos;. This method for designating polarization is
    similar to the convention used in many FITS formats, where a
    separate axis (often labeled &apos;STOKES&apos;) is used to give the
    full Stokes parameters of the data. However, full Stokes
    parameters have not measured in this archive, and so we have
    defined these new polarization axes to handle this
    situation.

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         Radio Astronomy is a developing new technique for the
    study of comets. In some areas, such as observations of the
    OH radical via its 18 cm transitions, the observational
    procedures and analysis are well developed. Studies in these
    areas have proved their value since they both provide new
    probes of important physical processes as well as a window
    on physical processes which are less well-known and less
    accessible to study by other techniques. In many other areas,
    however, the study of comets at radio wavelengths continues
    to be primarily an exploratory endeavor. In recognition of
    this fact, the IHW Radio Science Discipline Specialist team
    felt that it was important to attempt many different kinds of
    observations during this campaign on Halley&apos;s Comet, since each
    observation has scientific merit as an exploration. Thus, we
    have been careful to document and include all data submitted
    to this archive by radio observers.
 
         The P/Halley Archive contains data from 36 different
    observing groups, representing a range of techniques. The
    majority of the observational data comes in the well
    developed area of 18cm OH observations. However, many other
    projects were attempted as well. Approximately 75% of the
    groups who are known to have obtained useful data on the
    comet have submitted it to the archive, and we are grateful
    to them for their contributions.
