    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    Radar observations of Halley&apos;s Comet were carried out only
    at the Arecibo Observatory during November 1985. We have
    recorded the average echo obtained during this experiment in
    a single FITS file. The radar observation is made by
    transmitting a single frequency tone in one circular
    polarization toward the comet and observing the echo in both
    polarizations. The echo is observed in spectral line mode,
    and a detection is sought at the correct Doppler shifted
    frequency given by the ephemeris of the comet. Thus, since
    this data type is identical in most respects to a spectral
    line observation, the data are recorded in a similar format.
    For a specular reflection, the echo is expected to be
    polarized in the sense opposite to that of the transmitted
    signal. However, real surfaces often contain significant
    power in the same sense as that transmitted, perhaps due to
    multiple reflections on the target. We have treated the echo
    polarization in the same manner as the orthogonal
    polarizations in the OH experiments, but with a special key
    to designate the &apos;same&apos; and the &apos;opposite&apos; senses of
    polarization.
 
 
    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         Radio Astronomy is a developing new technique for the
    study of comets. In some areas, such as observations of the
    OH radical via its 18 cm transitions, the observational
    procedures and analysis are well developed. Studies in these
    areas have proved their value since they both provide new
    probes of important physical processes as well as a window
    on physical processes which are less well-known and less
    accessible to study by other techniques. In many other areas,
    however, the study of comets at radio wavelengths continues
    to be primarily an exploratory endeavor. In recognition of
    this fact, the IHW Radio Science Discipline Specialist team
    felt that it was important to attempt many different kinds of
    observations during this campaign on Halley&apos;s Comet, since each
    observation has scientific merit as an exploration. Thus, we
    have been careful to document and include all data submitted
    to this archive by radio observers.
 
         The P/Halley Archive contains data from 36 different
    observing groups, representing a range of techniques. The
    majority of the observational data comes in the well
    developed area of 18cm OH observations. However, many other
    projects were attempted as well. Approximately 75% of the
    groups who are known to have obtained useful data on the
    comet have submitted it to the archive, and we are grateful
    to them for their contributions.
