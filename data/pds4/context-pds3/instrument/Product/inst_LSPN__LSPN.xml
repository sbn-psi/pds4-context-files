    Instrument Overview
    ===================
    Given the difficulties in interpreting plasma-tail phenomena
    using sparse data sets, the obvious goals of the
    newly-formed L-SP Discipline Specialist Team in the
    early-1980s were the formation of as dense a global network
    as possible (consisting of facilities and observers with
    wide-field imaging capabilities), and the plugging of any
    critical holes in the temporal coverage provided by the
    &apos;fixed-site network&apos;, with mobile telescopes and observers
    to use them.
 
         Starting as early as the late-1970s (pre-IHW), several
    letters were sent out by the (eventual) L-SP Discipline
    Specialists to hundreds of observers and observatories
    worldwide, soliciting wide-field photographic imagery in
    support of a hoped-for NASA space mission to Halley&apos;s Comet.
    The response to these early queries, as well as to those
    which followed in the IHW era, were many and enthusiastic:
    it was clear that Halley would be well-observed and that
    astronomers would be willing to submit their data for
    archiving.
 
         The LSPN observers were extremely productive, and their
    willingness to ship the DS unique plate and film material
    for processing at NASA/GSFC was one of the keys to the
    assembly of this impressively large, and we think
    successful, archive. We received over 3,500 images of
    Halley&apos;s Comet taken on more than 100
    observatory/instrument/location combinations. The observers,
    their affiliations, the equipment used, and the observing
    sites, are listed in the section entitled &apos;Contributing
    Observatories in the Large-Scale Phenomena.&apos; of &apos;The Comet
    Halley Archive Summary Volume&apos; (Sekanina, Z., 1991)
 
         The global LSPN statistics are as follows. A total of
    3,383 L-SP images have been archived in the IHW compact
    discs, either as digital images or as &apos;dataless headers&apos; and
    listings. A total of 1,612 of the images are in digital
    form, 85% having been digitzed at NASA/GSFC and 15% having
    been digitized and provided by a few observers. A slightly
    larger group of 1,771 images were not digitized but are
    listed in several places in the IHW CD-ROM archive
    (discussed below). The vast majority of the 1,612 digital
    images are of Halley (1,439), and the remainder (173) are of
    various calibration objects. [The reader is referred to the
    LSPN chapter in &apos;The Comet Halley Archive Summary Volume&apos;
    (Sekanina, Z., 1991) for histograms showing the temporal
    distributions of the 3,383 total L-SP images and of the
    1,439 digitized images of Halley and for a sample
    photographic sequence of Halley].
 
         We regret that a small percentage of the images sent to
    the L-SP Discipline Specialist Team at NASA/GSFC could not
    be properly archived due to lack of information about the
    observations, an extremely late submission date to the
    Discipline Center, or both.

    Scientific Objectives
    =====================
         The 1985-86 apparition of Halley was different from
    past, largely unsuccessful attempts at global data collection
    (for comets), since enough effort was made to coordinate a
    worldwide observational program under the IHW banner. Toward
    that end, the Large-Scale Phenomena Discipline Specialist Team
    set a number of ambitious goals in the early-1980s; these are
    listed in summary form in the Table below. Also listed are
    the actual achievements of the L-SP Discipline and Network
    from the viewpoint of 1991; it is quite clear that the goals
    have been met, if not substantially exceeded, in all areas.
 
      Goals (early 1980s)                 Achieved (1991)
