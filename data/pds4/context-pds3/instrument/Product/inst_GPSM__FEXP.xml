    INSTRUMENT: GPS MICROTERRAIN
          HOST: FIELD EXPERIMENT
 
 
    Instrument Information
    ======================
      Instrument Id                  : GPSM
      Instrument Host Id             : FEXP
      Instrument Name                : GPS MICROTERRAIN
 
 
    Instrument Description
    ======================
      A field differential Geopositional Satellite (GPS) survey team
      deployed a pair of Motorola Eagle II GPS receivers.  The GLOTAS
      technique, as implemented at the time of GRSFE, involves
      recording GPS carrier phase data for at least 4 satellites
      simultaneously with two 8-channel receivers.  In this approach,
      one (master) receiver/antenna is fixed at a reference point
      (which can be surveyed in using GPS itself), and after a
      suitable calibration period, the second GPS receiver/antenna
      system is moved from its position beside the fixed master in
      whatever pattern is desired to develop a topographic profile or
      grid.
 
      The mobile GPS receiver/antenna permits positional data in all
      three axes (x,y,z) to be recorded at a rate of once per second,
      which can then be cross-referenced to the fixed master, and
      later tied to an absolute geodetic positional reference system.
      The primary interest was in relative horizontal position and in
      relative relief at each position.  Hence, an inverter was
      attached to a jeep battery to power a COMPAQ 386 computer to
      record all the GPS tracking data from both receiver/antenna
      systems.
 
      Data were collected by cabling the mobile GPS system to the
      computer by means of a 150-foot cable, which limited profiling
      length to just under 50 m.  A profile position was randomly
      chosen.  A 100 m long tape measure was used to demark the
      measurement positions, which were spaced every 5 cm except for
      flat inter-boulder regions, at which time measurements were
      made every 10 or 20 cm (our fractal assumption).  Measurements
      were made at 10 sec intervals (10 samples) at each data point,
      and moved the mobile GPS unit as rapidly as possible between
      ground sampling points.  The antenna was mounted on a
      fibreglass pole and attached on a circular plate at the top of
      the 6-foot long pole to minimize interference due to
      intervening people etc.
 
 
    Science Objectives
    ==================
      The objective was to measure the 5-20 cm scale microrelief at
      pixel scales (30-50 m long transects), with vertical control to
      the few cm level.  These microterrain profiles were to be used
      to help calibrate radar scattering models.
