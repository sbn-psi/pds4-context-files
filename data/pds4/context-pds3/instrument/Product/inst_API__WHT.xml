  Instrument Overview
  ===================
    The information in this document was taken from the website
    www.ing.iac.es/ on June 19, 2001.
 
    The Auxiliary focus is a facility provided in the Cassegrain
    Acquisition and Guider unit (A&amp;G box) to allow a direct image
    to be taken on-axis at the Cassegrain focus, at the expense of
    an extra (45 degree) reflection.
 
 
  Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The original idea of the system was that it could
    be used for short direct images of objects which were part of
    a mainly spectroscopic program, but it has emerged as the major
    instrument for a number of projects for which the high
    throughput in the ultraviolet provided by an all-reflecting
    optical system, or the 0.1 arcsec pixel size, are a particular
    advantage.
 
 
  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
    Local seeing can be degraded by the presence in the atmosphere of
    dust from Sahara dust storms, and by the presence of moisture or
    clouds.

  Filters
  =======
 
      Note: Additional information is available in
          DOCUMENT/U_MAN.PDF
 
    The Auxiliary focus filter unit is a box mounted at the
    Auxiliary port, which contains a 6 position filter. The
    maximum size of the filters to fit in this wheel is 51mm
    square or 55mm diameter. The filter unit also contains a CCD
    shutter 25mm in diameter, which is operated as normal by the
    CCD controllers. The filter wheel is controlled by the
    Cassegrain A&amp;G box.
 
    The standard methane filter was replaced with a filter provided
    by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia. It was a narrow
    band methane filter centered at 8920 Angstroms with Full Width
    at Half Maximum of 50 Angstroms. This filter was used for all
    of the API images of the inner Saturnian system.
 
    The remaining positions in the filter wheel were occupied
    by standard WHT filters which were used to make backup spectral
    observations of the E-ring as insurance in case the seeing did
    not prove good enough to use ISIS. The set included a copper
    sulfide filter (U), three Harris filters (B,V,R) and an I filter
    which was incorrectly identified as a Harris filter in the
    observing log, but was most likely the I filter from the RGO
    filter set.
 
    The Harris set of BVR are sandwiches of Schott glass selected
    to provide CCD analogs of the old Johnson photometric sequence.
    Until the Schott BG39 was developed, interference filters were
    required to cut red-leaks that CCDs were sensitive to. But
    interference filters deteriorate with time, so Harris at USNO
    found these combinations of very stable glasses that does the job
    quite well.
