Data Set Overview
=================
 
    The TVS data from KFKI came in various stages.  The
    initial submission from KFKI was completely replaced
    in the fall 1992.  At that time, additional processed
    data with aspect and range corrections were included.
     The original filenaming scheme was preserved except
    for changing the leading filename character and
    expressing the aspect ratio as &apos;a&apos;.

     Vega 1 Data:
 
    Later submissions included the images from March 5
    (60) and March 7 (186) before and after the encounter
    period (March 6 (7:21:00.9), 1986).  These data were
    given a file description to indicate if they were PRE
    or POST encounter.  The data is included in its
    original form but with a new filenaming scheme
    (TPREnnnn and TPOSnnnn), unique to the data set.  The
    data were sent as a separate image file (8 bit) with
    an ascii description of the header information.  An
    IHW-FITS file was created from this data in the style
    of the previous submissions, and approximate times
    were calculated from the TONBHRDW value provided with
    the data.  Since this is a relative value, the
    switch-on time was taken from a preprint by Laszlo
    Varhalmi (KFKI) and a previous communication with
    KFKI also gave the state vector for each spacecraft
    during the encounter.  Note that the switch-on times
    are then given as UT = Moscow time - 3 hours and a
    &apos;light travel time&apos; must be subtracted to match
    published values.  The algorithm for the midpoint of
    any exposure was calculated as follows:
 
 
UT (midpoint)
     = UT0+5.5+TONBHRDW/4.766485-T(exp)-T(loc)+T(exp)/2  (second).
 
 
    Note the clock count rate comes from a fit of times
    to original 63 images.  We have taken the 5.5 s
    correction from Varhalmi as due to a memory readout;
    another correction of 1.6 s called T (loc) was needed
    if the image was less than the full array which is a
    process time to find and transmit the data.
 
     For Vega 1, the assumed switch-on times were March
    5, 5h48m8s and for March 7, 7h 58m57s; these values
    are given as COMMENTs in the FITS header.  The state
    vectors for Vega 1 in equatorial XYZ coordinates are
    as follows:
 
 
    X=-51480466.2   Y=-106677747.1   Z=+4023544.7   (in km)
    V(X)=+33.4265   V(Y)=-10.6418    V(Z)=-2.7059   (in km/sec)
 
 
    It was asuumed these were barycentric coordinates and
    the linear velocities were used to estimate the
    coordinates for the new dates and times.  Appropriate
    values from the Nautical Almanac for 1986 were used
    to make the earth correction and eventually estimate
    the light travel time correction.  It was determined
    that the calculated UT times are consistent with the
    published values within 3 seconds; as such we leave
    the TIME-OBS keyword value (midpoint day fraction
    required by the IHW) as 4 significant digits.
 
     Unfortunately, in the processing it was discovered
    that 3 images in POST submissions from Vega 1 had
    inconsistent descriptions and were rejected.  Also,
    an error in the times provided in the revised FITS
    headers for the original 24 images (Nos 1-20, 25, 33,
    39, 61) was corected at SBN.  In one case, T01111,
    the FITS header had incorrect values for the exposure
    and it is not clear that the data is correctly
    matched with the header.
