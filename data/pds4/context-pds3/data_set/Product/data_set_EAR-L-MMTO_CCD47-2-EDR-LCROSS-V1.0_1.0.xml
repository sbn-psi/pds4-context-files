  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The LRO/LCROSS spacecraft was launched on June 18, 2009, and crashed into
    the Cabeus crater near the Moon&apos;s south pole on October 9, 2009. The spent
    upper stage, called the Centaur, impacted the moon at 11:31:19.51 UTC
    at -84.68 deg latitude, -48.69 deg longitude, Mean Earth frame, and the
    LCROSS shepherding spacecraft impacted the surface at 11:35:34 UTC.
 
    This dataset consist of frame-transfer CCD observations of the LCROSS
    impact site on the Moon and ancillary supporting data made on UT October
    9, 2009.
 
    These data were acquired using the MMTO 6.5-meter telescope
    coupled with a Marconi Applied Technologies CCD47 camera.  This is an
    engineering-grade CCD.  Specifications for the CCD47 are available at
    http://www.ccd.com/pdf/ccd_47.pdf.
 
    The CCD47 camera has a 1024 x 1024 array of 13-micron pixels, which were
    binned as 16 pixels x 16 pixels for the LCROSS observations.  The
    decision to bin these pixels was made in order to trade readout rate
    against spatial pixel size.  The camera reads out at a rate of 12.689
    Hz, or 78.808 ms/frame.  Of this total time, 71.269 ms is the exposure
    length.  The remainder is the time required to read out the chip.  The
    CCD47 camera is not cryogenically or mechanically cooled.
 
    The observations were obtained at the MMT 6.5-meter telescope on Mt.
    Hopkins in Arizona.  The facility is owned and operated jointly by the
    Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the University of Arizona.
    This is an altitude-azimuth telescope.  Adaptive optics designed and
    developed for the MMT incorporate an adaptive secondary mirror with
    incoming focal ratio of f/15.  During the LCROSS observations, the f/15
    adaptive optics secondary was used with the MMT natural guide star top
    box and the Clio camera.  Inside the top box, a beamsplitter divides the
    incoming light into visible and infrared components, routing light of
    wavelengths &lt; 950 nm to the CCD47.  The CCD47 camera was positioned in
    the top box to receive the visible light (lower wavelength range) signal
    from the beamsplitter.  The observations first used a neutral density
    filter ND2.5 followed by a filter having a central wavelength of 0.7 um
    with a 400-Angstrom wide passband.  These observations were taken
    concurrently with the infrared observations taken by Clio.  The infrared
    observations taken by Clio are described in the DATASET.CAT file for
    the data set EAR-L-MMTO_CLIO-2-EDR-LCROSS-V1.0.
 
    Observing conditions were photometric with seeing measured by wavefront
    sensor to be 0.38 arcseconds.
 
    The night of the LCROSS impact event was the only night we were able to
    take preparatory observations (other practice time allocated for
    observations was lost to bad weather).
 
    Processing
    ----------
 
    No processing of these images has been conducted.  These images are raw
    data; no calibrations or corrections have been made to the images.
 
    All CCD47 image exposures are the same exposure length as the
    program exposures (see above).  Normal processing includes the removal
    of a bias frame during which no exposure is made, but the background
    counts generated by the readout process are subtracted from the image.
    Bias frame exposures are included in the data.  A median filter of all
    or a subset of the CCD47 bias frames can be subtracted from CCD47 images
    of interest as part of the processing before analysis.
 
    Data
    ----
 
    The sequence of observations included observations of two A0 standard
    stars, HD22859 and HD43607 (http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/) used for
    wavelength calibration, and the solar analogue star HD28099 (Hya 64:
    e.g., Farnham et al., 2000; Hardorp, 1978) for data analysis of the
    lunar reflectance spectra.  The AO secondary system was used for these
    bright star observations.
 
    About 0.33 hr prior to the LCROSS impact, the AO secondary system was
    triggered on a bright star near the Moon; the secondary mirror was
    frozen in corrected figure to remove gross aberrations caused by the
    atmospheric fluctuations; flat fields of the sky with the configured
    secondary were obtained near the Moon, and the telescope was then
    pointed on the Cabeus crater target area. Observations covered a time
    range of 8 minutes before the first impact to 36 minutes after the
    second impact when twilight stopped observations.
 
    Images were taken of the Cabeus crater of the Moon where the impact was
    predicted to occur.  The impact observations did not show any
    discernible effect from the impact.  Quick-and-dirty image differencing
    immediately following the event did not show any signature of the event.
    Based upon the observed brightness of the impact by the LCROSS
    shepherding satellite, we expect that we would have been able to see the
    event had we not had unshadowed, illuminated portions of the lunar
    surface in the same field of view.  The observations are described in
    Hastie et al. (2010).
