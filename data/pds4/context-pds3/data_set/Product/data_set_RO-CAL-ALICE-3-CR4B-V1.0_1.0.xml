  Required Reading
  ================
 
    The format of all Alice data are described in detail by the EAICD
    document located in the /DOCUMENT directory. In addition, the
    Rosetta Alice logbook file, RA_LOGBOOK_NNN.ASC, also located in
    the DOCUMENT directory provides observational details such as
    observation target, commanded exposure time, etc., for all Alice
    data. The Alice team strongly recommends reading this
    documentation before using the data.
 
 
  Data Set Overview
  =================
 
    This data set contains calibrated data acquired by the Rosetta
    Orbiter ALICE UV Spectrometer during the Cruise 4-2 mission phase,
    which took place between 2008-10-06 and 2009-09-13. A detailed
    listing of all Alice observations is given in the observation log
    file located in the DOCUMENT directory.
 
    The following Alice observations were made during the period
    covered by this data set:
 
# 2009-01-29: Passive Payload Checkout #9 (PC9)
# NOTE: we have removed the second door performance test from the
 nominal
# passive checkout OIOR, so AALS404A is called only once.
#
 
# 2009-03-02: Flight Software v2.06 upload to EEPROMs 0, 1, 2
# (already loaded to EEPROM3 during PC8)
 
# 2009-03-12: Alice ON/OFF check after upload
# Basically a passive checkout without the door performance test
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
 
    The data in this data set are calibrated, CODMAC Level 3 data. As
    such, corrections for detector dead time, dark counts, flatfield,
    and effective area have generally been applied. The primary FITS
    header contains a list of which corrections have been applied to
    that file.
 
  Data
  ====
 
    The data are in FITS format and text format. Each FITS file has a
    detached PDS label so that they can be read either by FITS or PDS
    tools. A detailed description of the data format is given in the
    ALICE EAICD document located in the DOCUMENT directory of this
    data set.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    No ancillary data included in this data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
 
   The geometry items SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR,
   SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR and SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR provided in
   the label of the data product are relative to the Earth Mean
   Equator frame of J2000.
 
   SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE are given in the
   PLANETOGRAPHIC coordinate system. These parameters are computed at
   time t=START_TIME. Distances are given in km, angles in degrees.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    All FITS readers should be able to successfully read the data.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
 
    Data confidence is nominal, meaning that all data have been
    validated by the Alice team and found as expected. Any exceptions
    are noted by the DATA_QUALITY field in the label files.
 
 
  Review
  =====
 
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
 
    Data quality is good unless otherwise noted by the DATA_QUALITY
    keyword.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Although these data have been calibrated and are in physical
    units, the wavelength scale is unique to each individial
    file. Thus, care must be taken when comparing one data file to
    another. The Alice team recommends using the reformatted,
    calibrated CODMAC level 4 data products, which solves this
    problem.
