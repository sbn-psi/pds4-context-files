  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains raw 9P/Tempel 1 and science calibration images
    acquired by the Deep Impact High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
    (HRIV) during the 9P encounter phase of the mission.
 
    The 9P/Tempel 1 data are described in &apos;Deep Imact:  The Anticipated
    Flight Data&apos; by Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENTAL2005].  For more
    details about the images taken around impact, refer to the HRIV
    encounter data summary document which provides a log of the exposures
    taken from 28 hours before impact through lookback.
 
    The science calibration images are described in the &apos;Deep Impact
    In-Flight Calibration Summary&apos; document and are also discussed in the
    &apos;Deep Impact: Anticipated Flight Data&apos; paper by Klaasen, et al. (2005)
    [KLAASENETAL2005].  Calibration targets included 16 Cyg A, Achernar,
    Beta Hyi, Canopus, HD 60753, HD 79447, NGC 3114, NGC 7027, Vega, sky,
    an internal calibration (stimulator) lamp, and dark frames.  For a
    detailed discussion of how the instrument was calibrated, see &apos;Deep
    Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; by Klaasen, et al. (2006)
    [KLAASENETAL2006].

  Processing
  ==========
    The uncompressed and compressed FITS images in this data set were
    created by the Deep Impact Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell
    University and were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft header
    (the first 100 bytes of an uncompressed or 50 bytes of a compressed
    image) was extracted and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric
    parameters were computed using the best available SPICE kernels and
    the results were also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets
    were missing, the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the
    quality map included as a FITS &apos;IMAGE&apos; extension.  The image quality
    map was described in the calibration pipeline section of the &apos;Deep
    Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006)
    [KLAASENETAL2006].  The SDC did not apply any type of correction or
    decompression algorithm to the raw data.
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.

    -----------
      This data set contains compressed and uncompressed raw FITS images,
      that is, data as they were received on the ground.  Data compression
      was performed on board the spacecraft using a set of four lossy
      lookup tables.  A compressed FITS image consisted of 14-bit values
      compressed and stored as a one-byte pixel.  An uncompressed FITS
      image consisted of 14-bit pixels stored as two bytes.  The
      COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE in the data label indicates if an raw image
      is compressed or uncompressed.  The COMPRESSOR_ID identifies the
      lookup table that was used to compress an image.
 
      The calibration pipeline decompressed raw images.  For information
      about data compression, refer to &apos;An Overview of the Instrument
      Suite for the Deep Impact Mission&apos; by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005] or the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen,
      et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Target Name and Description
    ---------------------------
      The TARGET_NAME keyword in the data labels was set to the intended
      target, either &apos;9P/Tempel 1&apos; or &apos;Calibration&apos;.  The TARGET_DESC
      keyword provides the name of the specific calibration target,
      such as &apos;Dark&apos;.
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;&apos;As Seen By Observer&apos;&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the image labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = &apos;UP&apos;
 
      This topic is discussed in detail in the &apos;Quadrant Nomenclature&apos;
      section of the &apos;Deep Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; document.
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files is
      HVcccccccccc_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where cccccccccc is the
      spacecraft clock count at the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee
      is the exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels).  Up to 999
      individual images could be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      image number within an exposure ID corresponding to IMAGE_NUMBER in
      the data labels.  For example, if two images were commanded for
      exposure ID 9000022, the two FITS files names would be
      HV0173709840_9000022_001.FIT and HV0173709840_9000022_002.FIT.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw image data are in units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Imaging Modes and Filters
    ------------------------
      For descriptions of the imaging modes and filters, please see
      the Deep Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005].
 
      Most image modes had a set of bias overclock rows and columns,
      located around the edges of the image array.  All overclock pixels
      were excluded from the calculation of the values for MINIMUM,
      MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      The TIME_FROM_IMPACT_VALUE keyword in the data labels was based
      on the estimated impact time at the flyby spacecraft of UTC
      05:44:35.821 on 4 Jul 2005.
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SDC attempted to calculate geometric parameters relating to
      the target only when it was within several fields of view of the
      instrument boresight.  When these parameters could not be
      calculated, the corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were
      set to a value of unknown (UNK).  Also, geometry-related keywords
      for calibration targets such as Canopus were set to UNK.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  The Deep Impact
      project generated self-consistent SPICE kernels, outside of NAIF, to
      help account for the discrepancy.  The November 2005 version of
      these kernels was used to calculate the image times and geometric
      information in PDS data labels.  After further analysis of the
      timing problem in early 2006, improved self-consistent SPICE kernels
      were generated by the Deep Impact project.   These kernels are
      included in the DI SPICE data set.  For more information about
      this discrepancy, please see the spacecraft clock correlation
      document included on the Deep Impact document volume.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the November 2005 version of the SPICE data.  These were the best
    available data at the time of image creation.  Since image creation,
    some SPICE data have been improved, and these are archived in the
    Deep Impact SPICE data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
    Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
    the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
    and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
    calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
    earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
    left the target.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep
    Impact document volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used extensively by the science team to
    calibrate the instruments.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set passed a PDS peer review that took place on April 5,
    2006.  Reviewers stated these data should be archived pending
    resolution of the liens produced during the review.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All expected data were received on the ground and are included in
    this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data. The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing. For
    more information, refer to the notes about image quality map in the
    PDS data label or to the &apos;Deep Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; paper.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Raw HRIV CCD images are blurred because the HRI telescope was out of
      focus.  In-flight bakeouts during late February and early March 2005
      reduced the defocus from about 1.0 cm to about 0.6 cm, resulting in
      a decrease in the width of stars from about 12 pixels to 9 pixels.
      For more details, please see the instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].  The raw HRIV images in
      this data set have not been deconvolved.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software overwrote the first 50 uncompressed (or 100
      compressed) pixels of first quadrant read out from the instrument
      with an image header.  These original header pixels were included in
      the raw FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary
      dramatically, it recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and
      MAXIMUM keywords in the PDS data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL
      in the FITS header) be used to scale an image for display because
      these values exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows
      and columns located around the edge of the image.  The location of
      the header bytes in a FITS image depends on the readout order of the
      instrument, as discussed in the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      &apos;Deep Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; paper.
