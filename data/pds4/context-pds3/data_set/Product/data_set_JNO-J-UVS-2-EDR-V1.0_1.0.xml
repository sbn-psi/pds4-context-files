  DATA SET OVERVIEW
  =================
The Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) CODMAC Level 2 Experiment Data Record
is a collection of the far ultraviolet photon detections obtained by the UVS
instrument, in raw form.  As such, it constitutes the permanent record of the
raw UVS data.  These data include both the instrument science and housekeeping
data, organized into extensions within files formatted according to the
Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) standard, version 2.1b.  The UVS EDR
archive enables reprocessing of the raw science data as radiometric and
geometric calibration processing routines improve.  Investigators interested
in applying advanced calibration methods or needing to understand the properti
of the raw data will find the EDR products useful.  Most investigators, howeve
will be interested in using either the UVS data products contained in the CODM
Level 3 Reduced Data Record, as radiometric and geometric calibration processi
has already been done for these products, or the UVS CODMAC Level 5 far ultrav
map products.
 
 
  PARAMETERS
  ==========
    The fundamental measured parameters contained in the UVS EDR data set are
    the nearest time markers and the spatial and spectral locations on the UVS
    detector for each of the recorded far ultraviolet photon detection events.
    From these values raw calculated count rates (counts/sec) integrated over
    all spatial and spectral bins are also derived.  The sampling interval for
    the derived count rate values is determined by the commanded rate at which
    the time markers are inserted into the data stream.  This value will
    normally be set to 250 Hz.
 
 
  PROCESSING
  ==========
    UVS EDR data products will be generated at the UVS Science Operations
    Center (SOC), located at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio,
    Texas.  The products will be generated by an automated pipeline process.
 The UVS instrument will nominally generate one to many housekeeping telemetry
    files and science data files per orbit.  Once per day these UVS-generated
    files will be retrieved from the Juno spacecraft by the Juno Mission
    Operations Center (MOC) and then transferred by the MOC to the UVS SOC.
    The automated UVS SOC pipeline will ingest these files and invoke software
    to process them into EDR data product files.  No calibration of the scienc
    data will be done at this time.  Raw housekeeping telemetry values will be
    converted to engineering units, where applicable, and these converted valu
    will be included in the EDR data product files.
 
 
  DATA
  ====
    The UVS EDR data product file will contain the following types of data:
 
    1. Spectral vs. Spatial Image:  This is a reconstructed histogram generate
  from the pixel list data in the science data file.  Photon acquisition
  events will be binned according to their spectral and spatial components.
  This summary image is used as a &apos;quick-look&apos; check on data quality.
  [Extension 0 = primary FITS header and data unit (HDU)]
 
    2. Spatial vs. Time Image:  This is similar to the first dataset, but the
  data are binned based on spatial and temporal parameters.  The 360deg
  histogram will be split into 5 panels of 72deg. A new histogram will be
  started every time the scan mirror moves, as determined from the
  housekeeping data. This summary image is used as a &apos;quick-look&apos; check
  on data quality. [Extension 1]
 
    3. Frame List:  This dataset contains a list of the generated frame
  acquisitions. The list includes, for each frame, the instrument frame
  sequence number, start and stop times, tag bytes, quality factor and
  other instrument state information. The frame acquisition times and
  instrument state data contained in this list are used to
  cross-reference with the pixel list mode data for purposes of selecting
  data and checking timing consistency. [Extension 2]
 
    4. Scan Mirror Data: This dataset contains a listing of all scan mirror
  positions and information on when the mirror entered and exited each
  position. These data are taken from the housekeeping packets.
  [Extension 3]
 
    5. Raw Frame Data:  This dataset contains all of the raw data from the
  science data file except for the file header. [Extension 4]
 
    6. Analog Count Rate:  This dataset contains a sequence of time ordered
  photon count rates read from the housekeeping data packets.
  [Extension 5]
 
    7. Digital Count Rate:  Similar to the previous dataset, this will
  contain the count rate as determined from the raw science data.
  These data will be shown as counts/second. [Extension 6]
 
    8. Pulse Height Distribution (Lyman Alpha): This is one of three
  histograms where the bins are arranged as pulse height vs. time.
  One histogram will be created per spin. This histogram contains
  photons whose spectra are recorded on detector columns numbered
  between 850 and 930. [Extension 7]
 
    9. Pulse Height Distribution (Stellar): This is one of three
  histograms where the bins are arranged as pulse height vs. time.
  One histogram will be created per spin. This histogram contains
  photons whose spectra are recorded on detector columns numbered
  between 931 and 1770. [Extension 8]
 
    10. Pulse Height Distribution (Stim): This is one of three histograms
  where the bins are arranged as pulse height vs. time. One histogram
  will be created per spin. This histogram contains photons whose
  spectra are recorded on detector columns numbered between 0 - 149
  and 1950 - 2047. [Extension 9]
 
    11. Housekeeping Data:  This dataset contains the complete housekeeping
  dataset, both in raw format and, where applicable, in calibrated
  engineering units. HK data are included here to assist with joint
  instrument and data quality trending analyses (foreseen and
  unforeseen). [Extension 10]
 
    12. Parameter List: This table records the known values of the instrument
  parameter table, as reported in the housekeeping data. [Extension 11]
 
  ANCILLARY DATA
  ==============
    Ancillary data used in the generation of the UVS EDR data set include thos
    values required to convert instrumental engineering quantities contained i
    the housekeeping data from raw values to physical units.  These data have
    been obtained from the UVS engineers at the Southwest Research Institute i
    San Antonio, Texas.
 
 
  COORDINATE SYSTEM
  =================
    The UVS EDR data product is a CODMAC Level 2 product.  As such, the scienc
    data contained therein have not been corrected for instrumental effects,
    calibrated, or located in space.  The data are reported according to the
    two- dimensional detector coordinate system in X and Y (2048 x 256,
    respectively).
 
 
  SOFTWARE
  ========
    Because the UVS EDR data product files adhere to version 2.1b of the FITS
    standard, all FITS readers up to this standard should be able to
    successfully read these files.  There are many such FITS readers freely
    available in the public domain.
 
 
  MEDIA/FORMAT
  ============
    The UVS EDR data product files are written in FITS format, and the format
    of each file is described in an accompanying detached PDS label.  The EDR
    archive itself will be electronically delivered from the Juno SOC (JSOC)
    to the PDS Imaging Node, where it will be made generally available via
    the World Wide Web.
