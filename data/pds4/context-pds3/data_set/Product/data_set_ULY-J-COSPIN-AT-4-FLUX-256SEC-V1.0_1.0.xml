    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    The Imperial College Anisotropy Telescope
    -----------------------------------------
      (Last updated: 17 March 1995)
 
      This document describes the Anisotropy Telescopes, the
      data they provide, and the format of the data files
      provided by Imperial College to the Ulysses Data System.
 
      NB. Please take careful note of the following points:
 
      (1) THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS FILE CORRECTS AND UPDATES
          INFORMATION PRESENTED IN [SIMPSONETAL1992A] In particular,
          the Anisotropy Telescope pointing directions were given
          incorrectly in the Astronomy and Astrophysics paper, and the
          energy channel widths quoted there have since been updated.
 
      (2) See the Ulysses Data System guidelines for restrictions on
          the use of this data.
 
 
    1. The Anisotropy Telescopes
    ----------------------------
      The Anisotropy Telescope (AT) experiment is a two-telescope
      device. The telescopes are nominally identical with Telescope
      T1 pointing at 60 degrees to the spacecraft spin axis (i.e. in
      the Earthward looking hemisphere) and telescope T2 pointing at
      145 degrees (i.e. in the anti-Earthward looking hemisphere).
      They have a full-cone opening aperture of 70 degrees and a
      geometric factor of 0.7 cm^2 sr. Together they provide 80%
      coverage of the full sky. The most significant gap in the
      coverage is a cone with a half angle of 25 degrees centered on
      the Earthward pointing line along the spacecraft spin-axis.
      There is also a 5 degree gap in coverage between the two
      telescopes.
 
 
    2. The full AT Data set
    -----------------------
      Spin-averaged and sectored data in a variety of energy channels
      is produced by the ATs, as follows:
 
 
      Channel  Energy range      Energy Range      Sectored /
      number   /MeV (protons)    /MeV (alphas)     Spin-averaged
 
        1       0.7 - 0.9         2.3 -  2.5       Spin-averaged
        2       0.9 - 1.3         2.5 -  2.7       Spin-averaged
        3       1.3 - 2.2         2.7 -  3.0       Spin-averaged
        4       2.2 - 3.6             -            Spin-averaged
        5       3.6 - 6.5        24.0 - 28.0       Spin-averaged
        6       0.7 - 1.3         2.3 -  2.7       Sectored (8)
        7       1.3 - 2.2         2.7 -  3.0       Sectored (8)
        8       2.2 - 3.6             -            Sectored (8)
        9       3.6 - 6.5        24.0 - 28.0       Sectored (8)
       10           -             3.0 -  7.5       Spin-averaged
       11           -             7.5 - 12.0       Spin-averaged
       12           -            12.0 - 26.0       Spin-averaged
       13           -             3.0 -  7.5       Sectored (4)
 
 
    3. AT data provided to the Ulysses Data System
    ----------------------------------------------
      The AT data provided in these files is a subset of the total
      data set which is held at Imperial College.
 
      The format of these files is as follows:
      There is one data file per day. Each data file contains data
      records for every ten minute interval in the day, except
      during the Jupiter encounter (1992, days 25 to 48 inclusive)
      where data at 256s resolution is provided.
 
      Each record contains 17 fields of information, the first
      being a time-stamp referring to the centre time of the data
      contained in the remaining 16 fields. The definition of these
      fields, including their FORTRAN format, is given below.
 
      N.B. Fluxes quoted are from telescope T1, which points at 60
      degrees to the spacecraft spin axis.

      17     1pe10.4         Flux from channel 7, sector 8
 
      Each record can be read using the FORTRAN format
      &apos;(i4,4(1x,i2),1x,f6.3,16(1x,1pe10.4))&apos;
      or
      1x,a24,16(1x,1pe10.4)
 
      [please note that time-stamp and record format have been
       changed by the PDS/PPI Node for the sake of consistency with
       other data sets found on this volume]
 
 
    3.1 Definition of flux
    ----------------------
      in this table, flux means differential flux in units of
      (cm^2 sr s MeV)^-1 (NB. per MeV, not per MeV per nucleon).
      The fluxes have been computed by dividing the observed count
      rates by the geometric factor and the energy channel width.
      The energy channel width depends on species. Where a channel
      is sensitive to alpha particles and protons (i.e., channels
      1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9), the proton width has been used since
      normally the alpha contribution is insignificant. However,
      sufficient information has been given above to reconstruct the
      channel count-rates if necessary.
 
      All AT channels exhibit a &apos;background&apos; which may originate from
      electronic noise or from activation of the material of the
      telescopes or of the spacecraft. These background fluxes have
      been subtracted from the data provided in these files. Channel
      3 and channel 7 are the channels least affected by background
      and it is for this reason that channel 7 has been selected to
      provide the sectored data included in these files.
 
      The data have also been &apos;despiked&apos;, although it is not
      guaranteed that all spikes have been removed.
 
 
    3.2 Definition of sectors
    -------------------------
      All sectored channels except channel 13 have eight 45 degree
      sectors. Channel 13 has only 4 sectors. Sector 1 of channel
      13 is a 90 degree sector equivalent to sectors 1 &amp; 2 of any of
      the other sectored channels. Similarly, sector 2 of channel
      13 is equivalent to sectors 3 &amp; 4 of any other sectored
      channel, etc.
 
      The sectoring scheme is defined relative to the &apos;sun crossing
      line&apos;. The sun-crossing line is the line in the plane defined
      by the Sun, the Earth and Ulysses, which is perpendicular to
      the Ulysses-Earth line and which makes an angle of less than
      90 degrees to the Ulysses-Sun line. For channels with 8
      sectors, sector 1 is the 45 degree sector which starts from
      the sun-crossing line and extends in the sense of spacecraft
      rotation. Sector 2 begins at the angle that sector 1 ends and
      continues in the sense of spacecraft rotation, etc, continuing
      through to sector 8 which ends at the the sun-crossing line.
