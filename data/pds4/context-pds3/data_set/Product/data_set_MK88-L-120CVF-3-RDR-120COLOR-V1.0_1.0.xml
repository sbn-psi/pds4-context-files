            This archive contains lunar spectra measured with the McCord
            120-COLOR CVF NIR photometer on the Mauna Kea 88-inch telescope.

            This dataset consists of reflectance spectra of small lunar areas
            measured in 120 spectral channels from 0.62 to 2.6 micrometers
            using the McCord circular-variable-filter (CVF) near-infrared
            photometer. A small aperture allows light from the selected lunar
            area to pass through the CVF and onto the detector. Each spectral
            channel is obtained sequentially as the CVF is rotated. Data were
            acquired using the 2.2 m telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. All
            spectra have been scaled to a given wavelength. Spectral
            resolution varies somewhat from run to run. The first half of the
            CVF produces data at approximately twice the spectral resolution
            as the second half joined are unreliable. All data were acquired
            as relative reflectance spectra and were calibrated to scaled
            reflectance data using a directional-hemispheric (diffuse)
            spectrum of Apollo 16 soil acquired by J. B. Adams.

      [MCCORDETAL1981] and Pieters, 1986 [PIETERS1986] for more detail on
      the instrument and calibration procedures.
 
      Data files are named according to the scheme Hknnnn. H stands
      for Hawaii. The k represents the original archive tape on which
      the data were stored, and is related to the year of observation,
      as follows:
 
        8  - 1978
        9  - 1978
        A  - 1980
        B  - 1981
        C  - 1981
        D  - 1982
        E  - 1983.
 
      The last four digits are the sequential number of the file on the
      original archive tape.

      Acquisition of the 120 data points takes a few minutes; thus, a
      120-point spectrum can be affected by the accuracy of guiding on the
      Moon as well as changing sky conditions and instrument stability.  In
      most cases, several independent runs of data taken in sequence were
      averaged.  Error bars are the standard deviation of this average and
      only refer to the repeatability of the measurement under these
      conditions.
