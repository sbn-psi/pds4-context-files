  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains raw, 1.05- to 4.8-micron spectra of Mars
    acquired by the High Resolution Infrared Spectrometer (HRII) for the
    EPOCh project during the second cruise phase of the EPOXI mission.  One
    set of observations was acquired on 20-21 November 2009 to characterize
    Mars as an analog for extrasolar planets.  The observing period lasted
    approximately 24 hours, and spectra were acquired twice per hour.
 
    At every half hour of each observing period, the spacecraft slewed
    across the Mars while the IR spectrometer recorded data; these
    scans were performed three times within several minutes, alternating
    direction from south-to-north and north-to-south.  Each scan
    consisted of eight 128x256 binned subframes.  Each half-hour set
    alternated between slower scans with longer frame exposure times
    and faster scans with shorter frame durations.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial/along-slit) FITS
    spectral images and PDS labels in this data set were generated by the
    Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s Science
    Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  The FITS data were assembled
    from raw telemetry packets sent down by the flyby spacecraft.
    Information from the embedded spacecraft header (the first 100 bytes of
    quadrant A image data) was extracted and stored in the primary FITS
    header.  Geometric parameters were computed using the best available
    SPICE kernels and the results were also stored in the FITS header.  If
    telemetry packets were missing, the corresponding pixels were flagged
    as missing in the quality map included as a FITS image extension.  The
    quadrant nomenclature and the image quality map are described in the
    Deep Impact instrument calibration document and the EPOXI SIS document
    included in this data set.  The SDC did not apply any type of
    correction or decompression algorithm to the raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw spectral image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit
      contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the fastest
      varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from about
      1.05 to 4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding to
      the spatial or along-slit dimension.  The primary array is
      followed by one image extension that contains a two-dimensional
      pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This extension uses one byte of eight
      bit flags to indicate the quality of each pixel in the primary
      image.  The data label provides a short description of each bit.
      For more information about the FITS primary image and its
      extension or for examples of how to access and use the quality
      flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document or the Deep Impact
      instrument calibration document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in a
      data label.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HIyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;HI&apos; identifies the HRII
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images can be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Spectral scans often had 32 or more frames for one specific exposure.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      frame number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in
      the data labels.  For example, if 8 frames were commanded for a scan
      with an exposure ID of 1000002, the first FITS file name would be
      HI09112011_1000002_001.FIT and the last would be
      HI09112011_1000002_008.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      Although raw data numbers for HRII frames could be compressed on
      board the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table then downlinked,
      processed, and archived in the same format, Mars spectra acquired
      during the time period covered by this data set were never
      compressed.  Therefore the COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE keyword in the
      data labels is always set to &apos;UNCOMPRESSED&apos;.  For more information
      about this topic, see the image compression section of the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration documents.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS
      has a brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Spectral Scans
    --------------
      Each IR scan across the Mars consists of multiple frames within
      one exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in the data labels).  To work with
      these spectral scans, it is recommended that all frames for one
      exposure ID be stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a
      spatial-spatial map can be produced for a specific wavelength by
      selecting the appropriate spectral column from the image cube.
      Spectral wavelengths are provided by the second FITS extension,
      the spectral registration (wavelength) map.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      For a comparison of the relative locations of the IR slit with
      respect to the fields of view of the Medium Resolution Instrument
      Visible CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV), see the relative boresight alignments section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
    Timing for Spectra
    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction
      is vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out
      from the left and right edges and toward the center and starting
      with the first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at
      the top of the display.  Since the detector is reset and read out
      on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at
      which each pixel is exposed, although each pixel has the same
      exposure duration.  Additionally, the end of the spectrometer slit
      that always points roughly towards the sun is the first line to be
      readout and the last line to be read out is furthest from the sun,
      assuming the spacecraft is in its usual orientation with the solar
      pointing roughly toward the sun.  For more information about the
      timing of the spectra, see the IR focal plane and quadrant
      nomenclature sections of the Deep Impact instrument calibration
      document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw spectral image data have units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      One image mode was used for all HRII Mars spectra:
 
                    X-Size  Y-Size  Bin
        Mode Name   (pix)   (pix)  Type  Comments
        ---- ------ ------  -----  ----- ---------------------------------
          2  BINSF1   512     126   2x2  Binned sub-frame
 
      In the table above, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is
      the spatial dimension.  For a thorough description of the imaging
      modes, please see the Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a
      brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Mars-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For Mars observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The UTC and geometry values included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    products were generated.  The final, best SPICE kernels will be posted
    on the NAIF/SPICE web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ and
    archived in the PDS data set DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0 after the end
    of the EPOXI mission.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels, unless specified otherwise (e.g,
    SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    data set.

    The PDS Small Bodies Node held a peer review for this data set on
    29 September 2010.  The reviewers certified this data set for
    scientific use and archiving on 29 September 2010.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this data set.  All Mars observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernel (SCLK) used to compute UTC
      values in the data labels and FITS headers has known discontinuities
      of up to a second.  If time and funding permit, the EPOXI project
      will provide more precise times after the mission ends.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in 2005
      indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus
      problem does not significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more
      details, please see the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen,
      et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw FITS
      images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically, it is
      recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM keywords in
      the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS header) be
      used to scale an image for display because these values exclude the
      header bytes as well as the reference rows and columns located around
      the edge of the spectral image.  For more information, see the
      quadrant nomenclature section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document or the EPOXI SIS document.
