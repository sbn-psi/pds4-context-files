            This data set presents results from the Iona Mass Spectrometer

            during the encounter with 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup.

            This data set lists counts as a function of either angular
            position or energy level. The data were obtained from the Ion
            Mass Spectrometer (IMS) High Intensity Spectrometer (HIS)
            instrument flown aboard the GIOTTO spacecraft during its extended
            mission to fly by comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup. These data have not
            been formally reviewed by PDS.

      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This data set lists counts as a function of either angular position or
      energy level.  The data were obtained from the Ion Mass Spectrometer
      (IMS) High Intensity Spectrometer (HIS) instrument flown aboard the
      GIOTTO spacecraft during its extended mission to fly by comet
      26P/Grigg-Skjellerup.
 
      Parameters
      ==========
      Each data file lists a series of observations, one per record.  Each
      record contains the date, start time, stop time and distance of the
      spacecraft to the comet, in addition to the counts/spin recorded in
      each bin.
 
      The hisang file uses a 2-dimensional azimuth-elevation grid of bins.
      The hisenr file uses a 2-dimensional energy-elevation grid of bins.
 
      Processing
      ==========
      The data were received by the Small Bodies Node from Dr. Kathrin
      Altwegg, in FITS ASCII format and already fully processed.  The SBN
      only performed reformatting of the data supplied.
 
      Data
      ====
      The primary data files in this set are:
 
           hisang        counts binned by azimuth and elevation
           hisenr        counts binned by energy level and elevation
 
      Both PDS ASCII table and FITS ASCII table versions of these data files
      are supplied.
 
      The data were received as slightly non-standard FITS ASCII tables.  In
      reformatting the data, SBN personnel made the following changes:
 
        o  The FITS files were reformatted to full conformance with the
           ASCII tables standard.
        o  PDS tables were prepared by stripping off the FITS headers,
           removing trailing blanks and inserting carriage-control.
 
      It was noted that the last byte of each record seemed to have been
      truncated, but this was found to be true in the original file supplied.
      Communication with Dr. Altwegg indicated that it was not possible to
      reconstruct the missing data prior to the deadline for producing the
      GEM data collection, and so the missing byte has been noted but not
      restored.
 
      It was also noted that the timing data for record 1363 in both files
      was corrupted.  This could not be restored.  The record has been left
      as it was received.
 
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      Two additional PDS ASCII table files have been created by the SBN and
      supplied with this data set.  These files list the value ranges for
      the bins alluded to in the &apos;hisang&apos; and &apos;hisenr&apos; file descriptions.
 
         hisandbn.tab    lists the azimuth and elevation ranges for &apos;hisang&apos;
         hisenrbn.tab    lists the energy and elevation ranges for &apos;hisenr&apos;
 
      Media/Format
      ============
      These data are included on the Giotto Extended Mission (GEM) CDROM,
      available from the PDS SMall Bodies Node and similar data suppliers.

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
