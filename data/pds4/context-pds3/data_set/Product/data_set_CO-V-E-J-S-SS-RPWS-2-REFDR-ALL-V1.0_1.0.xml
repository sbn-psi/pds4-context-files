  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) raw complete data
    set includes all RPWS telemetry data for the entire Cassini mission.
    This data set includes raw telemetry values for each frequency
    channel for each sensor for all times during the mission including
    the two Venus flybys, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter flyby,
    interplanetary cruise, and the entire Saturn tour.  Data for this
    data set are acquired from the RPWS Low Frequency Receiver (LFR),
    Medium Frequency Receiver (MFR), Medium Frequency Digital Receiver
    (MFDR) (which can be used to replace MFR band 2 data), High
    Frequency Receiver (HFR), Sounder, and Langmuir Probe (LP).  Data
    are decompressed and internal receiver minipackets are unsegmented.
    This data set is intended to preserve the telemetry data and is to
    be used only as a last resort.  Other RPWS archived data sets are
    designed to be complete and more easily used.  Browse data sets
    associated with the other data sets provide a graphical search of
    the data included in this data set.  This data set should be the
    last used by a user of any of the RPWS archive as it is in the least
    user-friendly form.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    This data set includes all measurements from each sensor, frequency
    channel, and time step for which data were acquired by the RPWS.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw
    telemetry packets into complete sets and de-compress the data that
    were compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the
    RPWS flight software onboard.  Information included in the Software
    Users Guide included in the DOCUMENT directory on this volume
    provides information necessary to extract and use these data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The data included in this data set are the complete set of RPWS
    telemetry.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Ancillary data included with this data set collection include a
    series of files that describe the modes of the RPWS as a function of
    time and provide a time- ordered listing of Instrument Expanded
    Block (IEB) trigger commands (the mode by which the RPWS is
    reconfigured).  Also a detailed description of each of the modes (or
    IEBs) is provided.
 
    Other data which are ancillary to this data set but which are
    archived separately from this collection are the Navigation and
    Ancillary Information Facility&apos;s SPICE kernels describing the
    position and attitude of Cassini and various solar system bodies as
    a function of time.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The data in this data set are measurements of wave electric and
    magnetic fields measured by the RPWS electric and magnetic sensors.
    These fields are presented as detected by the sensors and are not
    rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the
    spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in
    analyzing these data.  However, for many purposes, the wave
    amplitudes are extremely useful and may be entirely adequate with no
    coordinate transformations at all.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    No software is provided to be used with this data set.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    These data are supplied to the Planetary Data System on DVD-R media
    using formats and standards of the PDS for such media.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set contains all the telemetry data for the Cassini RPWS
    instrument for the interval described In the label files for the
    individual data files.  Every effort has been made to ensure that
    all data returned to JPL from the spacecraft are included.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The RPWS raw complete data will be reviewed internally by the
    Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will
    also be peer reviewed by the PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general, the
    instrument was operated only briefly during early tour for the
    following intervals:
 
    1.  Antenna deployment   1997-10-25T00:00 - 1997-10-26T05:30
    2.  Venus 1 flyby        1998-04-26T12:54 - 1998-05-08T19:21*
    3.  Instrument Checkout  1998-12-30T09:10 - 1999-01-19T05:40
    4.  Venus 2 flyby        1999-06-24T09:08 - 1999-06-24T21:20
    5.  Earth flyby          1999-08-13T17:39 - 1999-09-14T22:20
 
    *Actual interval for science data is much shorter than this.
 
    Beginning in February of 2000 the instrument was operated
    more-or-less continuously; two gaps of the order of six weeks were
    incurred for the purposes of loading new attitude control and
    command and data system flight software, gaps of a few days each
    were incurred approximately twice per year because of Huygens Probe
    testing, and gaps of several days in duration occurred during solar
    conjunction periods prior to 2002. Remaining gaps are due to
    spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply to downlink gaps, some of
    which were imposed by limitations on DSN station availability.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    One measurement quality issue is occasional elevated noise levels
    (by a few to 10 dB) in the second band of the MFR. During tour, it
    is anticipated that data from the Waveform Receiver (WFR) sometimes
    referred to as the medium frequency digital receiver (MFDR) can be
    substituted for these in the full resolution data product (RPWS LOW
    RATE FULL).
 
    Beginning approximately with Saturn orbit insertion in early July
    2005, the RPWS has shown increasing sensitivity in its electric
    field measurements below 2 kHz to interference from the spacecraft
    reaction wheels.  The wheels are a source of electromagnetic
    interference in the magnetic channels at frequencies directly
    related to the rotation rate of the wheels due to a residual
    magnetic moment in the wheels.  This level was predicted before
    launch and has been basically constant through flight.  However, at
    the earliest opportunity to observe the interference of the wheels
    on the electric field measurements, there was essentially no
    detectable level of interference.  However, after orbit insertion,
    it became clear with increasing time that the wheels were becoming
    an increasing source of interference in the electric field
    measurements at about 2 kHz and below.  As of late 2005, the
    amplitude of this interference is of the order of 30 or 40 dB above
    the instrument  noise level.  The relation of the frequency of the
    electric interference to the rotation rate of the wheels is less
    direct than for the magnetic interference.  There is a general
    correspondence, but not in detail.  It appears that there are some
    frequencies more susceptible to the interference than others and
    when the wheel speed approaches these &apos;resonances&apos;, the interference
    becomes more visible.  A working model for this interference
    proposes that radiation effects on some part(s) of the spacecraft,
    perhaps the thermal blankets, reduce the conductivity.  Small
    vibrations of this part(s), then, with some residual differential
    charging then result in the electric field interference.  This model
    is not confirmed and the true explanation of the interference is
    unknown, but the effects significantly complicate the interpretation
    of the electric field spectrum below 2 kHz.
 
 
  SCET Miscalculation
  ===================
    Version 1 of CORPWS volumes:
 
       CORPWS_0122 through CORPWS_0165
 
    were processed using invalid SPICE spacecraft clock kernels.
    Specifically the SCLKs which spice was asked to convert to SCETs
    were outside the valid correlation region.  The error was subtle at
    first but continued to grow as SCLKs further from the correlated
    region were converted to SCETs.  The net result was that incorrect
    SCET values were placed into the product files and product label
    files for these volumes.  The issue has been corrected and no longer
    affects any CORPWS volumes available from the PDS.  The following
    table lists the maximum SCET errors by volume.

    Only volumes CORPWS_0122 through CORPWS_0165 with
 
        VERSION_VERSION_ID = 1
 
    in the VOLDES.CAT file are affected.  If VERSION_VERSION_ID is
    greater than 1, or the volume number is less than 122, or the volume
    number is greater than 165 then the volume in question is unaffected
    by this issue.
