  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains raw and reduced near-infrared images of
    comet 9P/Tempel 1, the target of the Deep Impact mission. Images
    were obtained from UT July 2-9, 2005, before, during, and after
    the Deep Impact encounter by M. Knight, R. Swaters, and N.
    Samarasinha using the Simultaneous Quad Infrared Imaging Device
    (SQIID) on the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) 2.1-m
    telescope.
 
    Observations were made simultaneously in J (1.1-1.402 microns), H
    (1.535-1.809 microns), and K (1.95-2.30 microns). L band images
    were not saved due to saturation of the detectors caused by the
    high sky background in the summer. The calibration procedure and
    photometric results are described in detail in the paper
    &apos;Ground-based visible and near-IR observations of Comet 9P/Tempel
    1 during the Deep Impact encounter&apos; by Knight et al. 2007
    [KNIGHTETAL2007].
 
    The published light curve for this data set is being combined with
    that of the optical data set collected on 2-5 July 2005 from
    San Pedro Martir (DI/EAR-C-I0276-2/3-MARTIR15M-TMPL1-V1.0) and is
    in preparation at the Small Bodies Node.
 
    Processing
    ==========
    Images were processed using the IRAF UPSQIID package. The UPSQIID
    package is available for download at
    http://www.noao.edu/kpno/sqiid/upsqiid.tar.
    A guide to data reductions using UPSQIID is available at
    http://www.noao.edu/kpno/sqiid/upsqiidpkg.html.
    Both the UPSQIID IRAF package (UPSQIID.TAR) and the guide to
    reductions (UPSQIIDPKG.*) are reproduced in this archive with
    permission from NOAO.
 
    A dark frame was created for each filter, exposure, and coaddition
    combinition using the USQDARK routine. This incorporates both the
    base current (bias) and a time-dependent current (dark). Flat
    fields were constructed for each filter each night from standard
    star fields and off source pointings using the USQFLAT routine.
    Processed images in this archive were created by subtracting the
    dark frame and dividing by the flat field frame.
 
    Images were processed further for the photometric calculations in
    Knight et al. 2007 [KNIGHTETAL2007]. This included correcting for
    non-linearity and subtraction of a median background. The response
    of the SQIID detectors is non-linear for large counts. In general
    this effect is small enough to be ignored. If the user wishes to
    correct for the non-linearity they should refer to the
    non-linearity section (section 8) of the SQIID user&apos;s manual
    (SQIIDMANUAL.*).
 
    The standard star field S791-C (RA = 13h17m29.6s, Dec =
    -05d32m37s) from Persson et al. (1998) [PERSSONETAL1998] was
    selected for its proximity to the comet in both RA and Dec
    throughout the run, allowing standard star observations to be
    interspersed with comet observations. The stars in the field were
    used to calculate atmospheric extinction corrections and absolute
    flux calibrations. For photometric calculations, additional
    standard star photometry was obtained from 2MASS (Skrutskie et al.
    2006 [SKRUTSKIEETAL2006]).  Magnitudes were calculated using a
    circular 3.5 arcsec radius aperture (13 pixel radius).
 
    Further discussion of the calibration and photometric results can
    be found in Knight et al. 2007 [KNIGHTETAL2007].
 
 
    Data
    ====
    This data set consists of a calibrated photometry table and plot,
    1770 reduced images (1413 comet frames, 72 sky frames, and 285
    standard star frames) and 2894 raw images (1124 dark frames
    plus the same 1770 frames in the reduced archive). The reduced
    images are supplied as flattened, bias and dark subtracted
    two-dimensional FITS image files with headers produced by the
    SQIID data acquisition software.
 
    The geometric circumstances of the comet and the sky conditions
    from Knight et al. 2007 [KNIGHTETAL2007] are reproduced here.
