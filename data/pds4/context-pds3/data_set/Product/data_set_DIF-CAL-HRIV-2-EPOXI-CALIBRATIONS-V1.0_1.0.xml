  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains version 1.0 of raw calibration data
    acquired by the High Resolution Visible CCD (HRIV) during the
    EPOXI mission.  The data for this version were collected from
    04 October 2007 through 17 December 2008, during the first cruise
    and EPOCh phases of the mission as well as the early part of the
    second cruise phase.  Future versions of this data set will
    include calibrations acquired during the remaining part of the
    second cruise phase and the 103P/Hartley 2 encounter phase of
    the EPOXI mission.
 
    The purpose of these data are to monitor the HRIV CCD and improve its
    calibration as needed.  Therefore EPOXI calibration activities for the
    instrument generally followed those designed for Deep Impact.  For
    example standard calibration targets continue to include the Moon,
    16 Cyg A, Achernar, Beta Hyi, Canopus, HD 60753, HD 79447, NGC 3114,
    NGC 7027, Vega, sky frames, stim lamp frames, and dark frames.  For a
    detailed discussion of how these data are used to calibrate the
    instrument, see the Deep Impact instrument calibration publication by
    Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].  The calibration
    observations for EPOXI are based on those designed for Deep Impact
    which are discussed by Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].
    Additionally HD 80607 was imaged in early November 2007 as a
    preliminary photometry check for EPOCh exoplanet transit observations.
 
    A list of the calibration activities relevant to this data set is
    provided here and a description of each activity follows.

      Instrument Checkout:  On 4 October the three science instruments
      were turned on for the first time in more than two years.  Sky
      frames acquired by the HRIV  CCD confirmed the mechanical components
      such as the shutter and filter wheel were functioning.  The
      instrument exhibited nominal behavior of background levels.
 
      EPOCh Photometry Test:  On 4-9 November 2007, EPOCh photometry tests
      were performed.  During these tests, the HRIV instrument observed a
      bright (V=9) visual binary star (HD 80607) for 12 continuous hours
      to check pointing and photometric stability.  The observations were
      taken using the 256-by-256 sub-array mode of the HRIV CCD.  The
      spacecraft successfully captured the star images and held them on
      the sub-array for the full duration of the test.  However the images
      were unexpectedly offset by 29 microradian (12.2 arcsec).  This was
      due to stellar aberration, which was not included for stellar
      observations during the Deep Impact mission.  After correcting for
      aberration, the spacecraft pointing was within specifications.
 
      HRIV Scattered Light Calibration:  On 17 December 2007, a
      calibration for scattered light using Earth&apos;s moon was performed
      for the HRIV instrument.  Many of these images were obtained with
      the moon outside but near the field of view of the HRIV CCD to
      allow analysis of the amount of light that is scattered into the
      field of view from bright objects just outside or within the field
      of view.
 
      Lunar Calibration:  On 29 December 2007 as the spacecraft approached
      Earth, the three science instruments used the Moon as a target to
      acquire data for recalibration purposes.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  On 9 January 2008, the first of the
      standard cruise calibrations for the three science instruments was
      performed.  The calibration sequence included observations of
      several standard stars, both solar analogs and hot stars with few
      absorption lines in their spectra for absolute calibration of all
      instruments, a stellar cluster for checking geometric distortion in
      the cameras, and a planetary nebula for checking the wavelength
      calibration of the spectrometer.  This sequence was designed such
      that it could be rerun, with few if any changes, after completion
      of the EPOCh observations and then again just before and just after
      the observing program for comet 103P/Hartley 2.
 
      EPOCh Darks/Stims for Transit Obs:  Observations of EPOCh transiting
      extrasolar planets were bracketed by sets of dark and internal
      stimulator lamp frames to aid photometric analysis.  These frames,
      acquired from 22 January through 31 August 2008, are sub-frame
      images (256x256 or 128x128 pixels) with exposure times of 50 or 100
      milliseconds.  Unique exposure IDs were assigned for these
      EPOCh-specific calibrations:  9600000 and 9600001 for the darks and
      9600002 and 9600003 for the stim lamp frames.
 
      EPOCh Darks for Earth Obs:  At the end of each Earth observation
      period, a set of HRIV dark frames was acquired for calibration
      purposes and is included in this data set.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  A second standard cruise calibration
      was performed on 23-25 June 2008 for the HRIV and HRII instruments.
      The sequence was very similar to that used for the calibration
      performed on 9 January 2008, except the MRI instrument was turned
      off because of thermal and telecommunication concerns.
 
      HRIV PSF Calibration:  On 17 December 2008, additional data were
      acquired for improving point spread functions (PSF) for the HRIV
      CCD. Analysis of early EPOXI calibration data and EPOCh stellar
      observations indicated the PSFs had changed since mid-2005 when the
      functions were last generated for Deep Impact.  The project plans
      to rerun this sequence in 2010 for the Hartley 2 flyby.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and
    the image quality map are described in the Deep Impact instrument
    calibration document and the EPOXI SIS document included in this data
    set.  The SDC did not apply any type of correction or decompression
    algorithm to the raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw HRIV image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte of eight bit flags to indicate the quality of
      each pixel in the primary image.  The data label provides a short
      description of each bit.  For more information about the FITS primary
      image and its extension or for examples of how to access and use the
      quality flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document or the Deep Impact
      instrument calibration document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in a
      data label.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;HV&apos; identifies the HRIV
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 32
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 1000000, the
      first FITS file name would be HV07122918_1000000_001.FIT and the last
      would be HV07122918_1000000_032.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      For some HRIV calibration frames the raw data numbers were
      compressed on board the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table
      then downlinked, processed, and archived in the same format.  A
      compressed image is identified by the value &apos;COMPRESSED&apos; in the
      COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE keyword in the data labels or the COMPRESS
      keyword in the FITS headers.  For more information about this topic,
      see the image compression section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS
      has a brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of HRIV to the Medium Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (MRI) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the relative boresight alignments section of the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw image data are in units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Target Name and Description
    ---------------------------
      The TARGET_NAME keyword in the data labels is set to the intended
      target, &apos;CALIBRATION&apos;, for each observation in this data set. The
      TARGET_DESC keyword provides the name of the specific calibration
      target, such as &apos;DARK&apos; or &apos;VEGA&apos;.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      For a thorough description of the imaging modes, please see the
      Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a brief discussion of
      this topic.  A summary of the imaging modes is provided here.
 
                     X-Size  Y-Size
        Mode Name    (pix)   (pix)   Comments
        ---- ------  ------  ------  ---------------------------------------
          1  FF       1024   1024    Full frame, shuttered
          2  SF1       512    512    Sub-frame, shuttered
          3  SF2S      256    256    Sub-frame, shuttered
          4  SF2NS     256    256    Sub-frame, not shuttered
          5  SF3S      128    128    Sub-frame, shuttered
          6  SF3NS     128    128    Sub-frame, not shuttered

          8  SF4NO      64     64    Sub-frame, not shuttered, no overclocks
 
      All modes are unbinned.  Most image modes have a set of bias
      overclock rows and columns, located around the edges of the image
      array.  All overclock pixels were excluded from the calculation of
      the values for MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in
      the data labels.  These overclock areas described in the Deep
      Impact instruments document and the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document.
 
 
    Filters

      A list of the characteristics of the HRIV filters is provided below.
      For more information about the filters, see the Deep Impact
      instruments document or the Deep Impact instrument calibration
      document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a brief discussion of this topic.

        9  ORANGE       650    100
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      that were calculated for the time when the light arrived at the
      target and the earth-observer-to-target values that were calculated
      for the time when the light left the target.
 
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this data set
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However as
      this data set was being produced, the mission operations team
      figured out how to correct raw clock correlation data for the
      flyby spacecraft to allow timing fits that are accurate to at
      least the sub-second level.  The project plans to generate a
      complete, corrected set of correlations since launch.  This will
      ultimately result in a future version of a SCLK kernel that will
      retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI
      data.  When this kernel is available, it will be added to the
      SPICE data sets for the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE
      web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  NAIF used these kernels to produce the
    EPOXI SPICE data set, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    data set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project and were used extensively by the science teams to improve
    the calibration of instrument.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set is archived at the PDS Small Bodies Node (SBN) and the
    Multi-Mission Archive at STScI (MAST).  It passed a peer review held
    by SBN on 23 July 2009; MAST personnel participated.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this data set.  All calibration
    observations received on the ground were processed and included in this
    data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in
      2005 indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  In-flight
      bakeouts during late February and early March 2005 reduced the
      defocus from about 1.0 cm to about 0.6 cm, resulting in a decrease
      in the width of stars from about 12 pixels to 9 pixels.  For more
      details, please see the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006] and the Deep Impact image
      restoration paper by Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the HRIV CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are biased during
      integration so that the centers of the two halves are apparently
      1/6 pixel closer to the center, and the two boundary rows show a
      decrease in sensitivity of 1/6.  Reconstructed image files space
      all lines evenly, so the true image is erroneously vertically
      pushed apart by 1/3 pixel at its center in these reconstructions.
      When making science measurements from HRIV images, one must
      therefore be very careful to properly account for the two flaws
      introduced by the apparently narrow central lines on the CCD - a
      geometric error that separates the image by an extra 1/3 pixel at
      the horizontal quadrant boundary, and 2) insertion of extra total
      radiance into calibrated images due to the flat-field correction,
      which corrects for an apparent radiance deficit in the two central
      rows because of the smaller number of photons actually incident on
      those rows.
 
 
    Out-of-Frame Target
    -------------------
      Some lunar calibration frames in this data set do not contain the
      moon because of deviations in pointing.  However the intended target
      is specified by the TARGET_DESC keyword in the data labels.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document or the EPOXI SIS document.
