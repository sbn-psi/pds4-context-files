  Data Set Overview
  =================
    OVERVIEW
 
    The data set lists orbital and physical properties for well-observed or
    suspected binary/multiple minor planets including the Pluto system,
    compiled from the published literature as inspired by Richardson and Walsh
    (2006) and similar reviews (Merline et al., 2003; Noll, 2006; Pravec et
    al., 2006; Pravec and Harris, 2007; Descamps and Marchis, 2008; Noll et
    al., 2008; Walsh, 2009).  In total 269 companions in 254 systems are
    included.  Data are presented in three tables:  one for orbital and
    physical properties; one for companion designations, discovery
    information, and reference codes for data values; and one giving full
    references for each reference code.  This data set is complete for
    binary/multiple components reported through 31 March 2015.
 
 
    ORBITAL/PHYSICAL PROPERTIES TABLE
 
    The first table (binarytable) lists orbital and physical properties of
    binary/multiple minor planets, with the following data:
 
       * minor planet number, name, and provisional designation;
       * minor planet dynamical type;
       * designation of companion;
       * minor planet heliocentric semimajor axis (AU), eccentricity, and
      inclination;
       * combined effective diameter (km) with uncertainty and note code;
       * secondary-to-primary diameter ratio with uncertainty and note code;
       * primary diameter (km) with uncertainty and note code;
       * companion diameter (km) with uncertainty and note code;
       * primary spin period (h) with uncertainty and note code;
       * companion orbit semimajor axis (km) with uncertainty and note code;
       * companion orbital period (d) with uncertainty and note code;
       * companion orbital eccentricity with uncertainty and note code;
       * primary geometric albedo with uncertainty and note code;
       * system mass (kg) with uncertainty and note code;
       * and system density (g/cm^3) with uncertainty and note code.
 
    Entries are sorted first by permanent number then by provisional
    designation.  Entries are included for all components in multiple (3+)
    systems.
 
    Dynamical type codes are as follows:
       1:2 = Neptune 1:2 resonance object,
       1:3 = Neptune 1:3 resonance object,
       2:5 = Neptune 2:5 resonance object,
       3:5 = Neptune 3:5 resonance object,
       3:8 = Neptune 3:8 resonance object,
       4:7 = Neptune 4:7 resonance object,
       AMO = Amor,
       APO = Apollo,
       ATE = Aten,
       CEN = Centaur,
       CUB = Cubewano,
       JL4 = Jupiter L4 Trojan,
       JL5 = Jupiter L5 Trojan,
       MB = Main Belt asteroid,
       MC = Mars crosser,
       ML5 = Mars L5 Trojan,
       PLU = Plutino,
       SDO = scattered disk object, and
       TNO = other Transneptunian Object.
    Dynamical types are based on the Minor Planet Center &apos;Unusual Minor
    Planet&apos; listings supplemented for outer solar system objects using
    classifications by the Deep Ecliptic Survey Team
    [http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/kbo/desclass.html] (see Elliot et al.,
    2005).
 
    Note codes indicate comments on data values as follows:
       A = assumed;
       D = derived from published measurements;
       E = estimated based on assumed values;
       G = greater than;
       H = (for periods) period of one-half the stated value also possible;
       L = less than;
       Q = (for period) multiple periods exist, with association of stated
       period with primary inconclusive;
       S = (for binary semimajor axis) projected separation distance.
 
    For objects without measured diameters, diameters are estimated by first
    obtaining the system effective diameter from
       D_c = 1320 km * A^-0.5 * 0.1^(H/5)
    where D_c is the effective diameter (D_c^2 = D_1^2 + D_2^2), A is the
    albedo, and H is the combined absolute magnitude (from the MPCORB
    Database).  Component diameters D_1 and D_2 are obtained from measured or
    estimated D_c using companion-to-primary diameter ratios D_2/D_1, either
    reported (e.g. derived from photometric lightcurve observations) or
    derived from magnitude difference between components (for binaries
    resolved by imaging), assuming identical albedos for both components.  If
    unmeasured, albedos are assumed to be 0.16 for NEAs/main belt asteroids
    and 0.09 for outer solar system objects.
 
    For some objects with unknown binary semimajor axis values, the projected
    separation distance is provided.  Estimated values of semimajor axis
    and/or orbital period are order-of-magnitude figures only, based on
    assumed values of density and/or albedo and (in some cases) assuming the
    binary semimajor axis is the same as the projected separation.  If
    unmeasured, system densities are assumed to be 1.6 g/cm^3 for NEAs/main
    belt asteroids or 1.0 g/cm^3 for trans-Neptunian objects.  Regarding
    uncertainties on measured values, readers are referred to the respective
    references.  Dashes or invalid inputs (usually -9.99) indicate unassigned
    or unknown values.
 
 
    COMPANION DESIGNATIONS/DISCOVERY INFORMATION/REFERENCES TABLE
 
    The second table (binaryothref) includes companion designations (either
    permanent or provisional), discovery information, and reference codes for
    data values listed in the orbital and physical properties table, as
    follows:
 
       * minor planet number, name, and provisional designation;
       * code for discovery detection method;
       * year of announcement of the discovery;
       * year of last update in this database;
       * and reference codes.
 
    Discovery method codes are as follows:  A = adaptive optics telescope
    imaging, C = combined radar/lightcurve observations, H = Hubble Space
    Telescope imaging, I = imaging, other or unspecified, L = photometric
    lightcurve observations, R = radar observations, S = spacecraft imaging.
    Year of last update corresponds to the year of the version of the most
    recent update or addition to physical or secondary orbital parameters,
    either V8.0 (31 March 2015), V7.0 (31 March 2014), V6.0 (31 March 2013),
    V5.0 (31 March 2012), V4.0 (31 March 2011), V3.0 (31 March 2010), or
    V2.0 (4 May 2009).  Reference codes are given for each orbital or
    physical property value, with codes referring to complete references
    listed in a separate file (binaryrefs.asc).  Dashes or spaces indicate
    unassigned values.
 
 
    REFERENCES TABLE
 
    The third table (references) has columns for reference codes and full
    reference information.
 
 
    MODIFICATION HISTORY
 
    Differences between the current database version and the previous version
    (2014) are:
 
       * The current version includes data on 269 companions in 254 systems,
      or 13 more components and 12 more systems than the previous release.
       * New or revised parameters are reported for 54 of the 256 companions
      included in the previous release.
       * Heliocentric orbit semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination are
      updated from the MPC Orbit (MPCORB) Database, and outer solar system
      dynamical types are supplemented by classifications from the Deep
      Ecliptic Survey Team.
 
    Modifications in successive versions are summarized as follows:
       * V1.0 (July 2006) listed 60 companions in 60 systems and included
      primary designation, dynamical type, primary and secondary diameters,
      primary rotation period, secondary orbital semimajor axis and period,
      and system mass and density, with references.
       * V2.0 (4 May 2009) listed 173 companions in 165 systems, added entries
      for additional components in multiple systems, added data on geometric
      albedo, discovery method, date of discovery announcement and secondary
      designation, added note codes and references linked to each data value,
      and added more specific dynamical types.
       * V3.0 (31 March 2010) listed 194 companions in 183 systems and added
      year of last update.
       * V4.0 (31 March 2011) listed 202 companions in 191 systems.
       * V5.0 (31 March 2012) listed 218 companions in 206 systems.
       * V6.0 (31 March 2013) listed 242 companions in 229 systems, added data
      on combined effective diameter, diameter ratio, and secondary orbital
      eccentricity.
       * V7.0 (31 March 2014) listed 256 companions in 242 systems.
       * V8.0 (31 March 2015) lists 269 companions in 254 systems.
