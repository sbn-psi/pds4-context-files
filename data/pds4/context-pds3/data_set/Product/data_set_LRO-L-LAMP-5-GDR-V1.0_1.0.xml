  DATA SET OVERVIEW
  =================
    The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP)
    CODMAC Level 5 Gridded Data Record is a collection of gridded data
    products (maps) derived from the far ultraviolet photon detections
    obtained by the LAMP instrument, corrected for instrumental effects,
    radiometrically calibrated, and correlated with the auxiliary information
    needed to locate the observations in space and time. These gridded data
    products are presented as standalone maps, formatted as standard PDS
    images, with detached PDS labels.  The LAMP GDR archive will be of
    interest to investigators studying the far ultraviolet properties of the
    Moon.
 
 
  PARAMETERS
  ==========
    The fundamental parameters contained in the LAMP GDR data set are:
 
    1) far-UV brightness
    2) far-UV albedo
    3) H2O absorption feature depths
    4) raw far-UV photon counts
    5) calibrated far-UV photon counts
    6) exposure times
    7) far-UV illumination
    8) statistical errors (noise)
    9) data quality
 
 
  PROCESSING
  ==========
    LAMP GDR data products are generated at the LAMP Science Operations Center
    (SOC), located at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.
    The map processing proceeds generally as follows.  (Please refer to the
    LAMP EDR and RDR Data Product SIS documents for more information about the
    LAMP EDR and RDR data products, as this discussion assumes the existence
    of LAMP RDR products containing radiometrically calibrated and spatially
    located far-UV photon detections.)  From each RDR product a corresponding
    &apos;exposure record&apos; is generated that records the exposure time of each LAMP
    spatial pixel in each map cell.  Calibrated photon counts (i.e.,
    photons/cm2, where the cm2 is related to the wavelength-dependent
    instrument effective area) from the RDR products are then paired with
    these exposure records, one-to-one, to produce integrated photon count and
    exposure maps.  These, in turn, are used to generate the brightness maps
    themselves.  Far-UV illumination models are separately used to estimate
    the time-dependent far-UV flux incident on the Moon&apos;s night side and
    permanently shaded regions (PSRs).  These, combined with the brightness
    maps yield the albedo maps.  Finally, the ratios of the off-band
    brightness/albedo to the on-band brightness/albedo yields the H2O
    absorption feature depth maps.
 
 
  DATA
  ====
    As alluded to above, the LAMP Gridded Data Record contains the following
    nine types of maps:
 
    1) far-UV brightness - units are photons/cm2/sec/sr
                         - four wavelength ranges are included:
                             Lyman-alpha  (119.57 nm - 123.57 nm)
                             full stellar (129.57 nm - 189.57 nm)
                             on-band      (129.57 nm - 155.57 nm)
                             off-band     (155.57 nm - 189.57 nm)
    2) far-UV albedo - units are dimensionless albedo
                     - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    3) H2O absorption feature depths (ratios) - units are dimensionless
    4) raw photon counts - units are photons
                         - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    5) calibrated photon counts - units are photons/cm2
                                - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    6) exposure times - units are secs
    7) far-UV illumination - units are photons/cm2/sec
                           - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    8) statistical errors (noise) - units are photons/cm2
                                  - the above four wavelength ranges are used
    9) data quality - units are dimensionless
                    - the above four wavelength ranges are used
 
    All of these maps are derived from &apos;night side&apos; data (i.e., when the LAMP
    detector FOV was located on the night side of the Moon or in a permanently
    shaded region [PSR] and the instrument aperture door was open).  In
    addition to the cumulative ensemble average maps generated using data
    taken during the whole nominal ESMD phase of the LRO mission, monthly maps
    are also provided for all of the above products except for the H2O
    absorption feature depth maps.
 
    Each map is a polar stereographic map centered on either the north or
    south lunar pole and extending 10 degrees in latitude away from the pole
    (i.e., to either +80 deg or -80 deg latitude).  Each map has a true
    resolution at the pole of 240 meters/pixel, thus yielding a map of
    2501 x 2501 pixels.  Each map element is stored using a 4-byte floating
    point value, thus giving a total size of 25 MB per map image.
 
    For each map type (except for the exposure and H2O absorption feature
    depth maps) there are 112 maps (4 wavelength ranges x 2 poles x 14
    [13 monthly + 1 cumulative]).  Since the exposure times are the same for
    all wavelengths, there are only 28 exposure maps.  Also, there are only
    4 H2O absorption feature depth maps (2 [brightness and albedo as ratio
    source] x 2 poles).  All told, there are 816 total maps in the GDR data
    set.
 
 
  ANCILLARY DATA
  ==============
    Other than the ancillary data used in the generation of the LAMP RDR data
    set, the only ancillary data specifically used in the creation of the LAMP
    GDR data set is the illumination model (used to generate the illumination
    maps, which are in turn used to derive the albedo maps).
 
    The ancillary data used in the generation of the LAMP RDR data set include
    those calibration values required to apply instrumental corrections and
    calibrations to the science data as well as trajectory and pointing
    information for the LRO spacecraft and clock conversion tables required
    to enable the geometric calibration of the science data.  The source of
    the instrumental calibration data are the LAMP engineers and LAMP
    scientists at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas
    [see GLADSTONEETAL2008 for further details], while the source of the
    spacecraft trajectory, pointing, and clock data are SPICE kernels
    provided to the LAMP SOC by the LRO MOC, having been ultimately generated
    by the MOC itself, the Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) at GSFC, or the
    Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL.
 
 
  COORDINATE SYSTEM
  =================
    The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission uses a standard coordinate
    system to describe all RDR (and hence GDR) data, namely lunar
    planetocentric/body-fixed coordinates with east-positive longitude from 0
    to 360 degrees.  A mean Earth/polar axis (ME) reference system (also
    called the mean Earth/rotation system) is used, with the z-axis being the
    mean rotational pole and with the prime meridian (zero degrees longitude)
    defined by the mean Earth direction.
 
    The ME reference system is used for all LRO archival data.  This LRO
    standard is documented in &apos;A Standardized Lunar Coordinate System for
    the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, LRO Project White Paper, 451-SCI-000958,
    Version 4, May 14, 2008&apos;.  Using coordinates in the ME system is
    consistent with recommendations from the International Astronomical Union
    (IAU)/International Association of Geodesy (IAG) Working Group on
    Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements.
 
    A Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) planetary and lunar ephemeris and
    corresponding Euler angle set are used to define an ME frame to which the
    LRO data are registered.  The LRO Data Working Group (LDWG) determines
    which ephemeris and Euler angle set should be used.  Alternatively, LRO
    data can be registered to an existing or new reference frame in the ME
    system, via ties to surface points known in the frame (examples include
    Lunar Laser Ranging [LLR] retroreflectors, points in images and Digital
    Elevation Models).
 
    When a JPL planetary and lunar ephemeris is used, the JPL Navigation and
    Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) provides the necessary lunar
    ephemeris file (SPK) and binary lunar orientation file (PCK) in a
    Principal Axes (PA) reference frame for use with the SPICE Toolkit.  NAIF
    also provides the frames kernel (FK) used for accessing the PA orientation
    in the PCK and for transforming from the PA frame to the ME frame.
 
    Alternatively, the JPL lunar ephemeris information is available in an
    ASCII format not requiring the use of the SPICE Toolkit.  This information
    is available from a JPL website: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov.
 
 
  SOFTWARE
  ========
    Because the LAMP GDR data product files adhere to the image format
    described in version 3 of the PDS standards reference, the PDS-supplied
    NASAView software should be able to successfully read these files.  There
    are likely other such image readers freely available in the public domain
    capable of reading the LAMP GDR maps.
 
 
  MEDIA/FORMAT
  ============
    The LAMP GDR data product files are written in standard PDS image (.img)
    format, and the format of each file is described in an accompanying
    detached PDS label.  The GDR archive itself will be written on hard drive
    media and physically delivered from the LAMP SOC to the PDS Imaging Node,
    where it will be made generally available via the World Wide Web.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
  Confidence level information is provided as part of the LAMP GDR data set
  itself, by means of the supplied statistical error and data quality maps.
  In the case where a given map cell contains no data at all, the value
  assigned is the IEEE NaN value.
