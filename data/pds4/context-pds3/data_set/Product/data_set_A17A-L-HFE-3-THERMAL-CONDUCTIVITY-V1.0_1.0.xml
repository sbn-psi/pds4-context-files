  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set comprises a reduced, subsampled set of the data returned
    from the Apollo 17 Heat Flow Experiment (HFE) from 12 December 1972
    through 31 December 1974.  The experiment consisted of two probes placed
    by the Apollo 17 astronauts in holes drilled in the lunar surface near
    the Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) site to measure
    the thermal conductivity.  For more information on the experiment and
    instrumentation see the instrument.cat file in this directory.  The data
    consist of a set of ten ASCII tables with time, temperature differences,
    and average temperatures readings measured by the thermocouples in the
    heat flow probes and probe cables.  The data have been restored and
    reformatted from binary data held on magnetic tapes at the NASA National
    Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) under NSSDC ID of PSPG-00022 (old
    NSSDC ID 72-096C-01A).
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The data for each probe are divided into 5 files.  All numbers in the
    files are of the form E14.7 (e.g. [1.8388079E+10]).  The first column
    in each file contains the time in milliseconds from 24 hours before the
    beginning of the year in which the mission was launched.  (Apollo 17
    was launched in 1972, so the time in milliseconds is measured from
    00:00 UTC on 31 December 1971.  For example, the elapsed time in
    milliseconds at 01:00 UT on 1 January 1972 would be 90,000,000.  The
    leap year 1972 and the single leap second added on each of 30 June
    1972, 31 Dec 1972, and 31 Dec 1973 -- in which the heat flow timing
    of elapsed seconds would keep counting while the UT clock would be
    &apos;stopped&apos; for a second -- were incorporated into the computed UT
    start and stop times in this data set.)  The files are arranged in
    chronological order with a few exceptions noted at the end of this
    description. Files 1, 2, 4, and 5 contain the temperature difference
    between the upper and lower ends of the bridge (column 2) and the
    average temperature (column 3) in degrees Kelvin. File 1 is for the
    upper section gradient bridge (DTGx1, x is the the probe number), file
    2 for the lower section gradient bridge (DTGx2), file 4 for the upper
    section ring bridge (DTRx1), and file 5 the lower section ring bridge
    (DTRx2).  Note that for each bridge, the upper sensor is designated
    with an &apos;A&apos; and the lower sensor with a &apos;B&apos; (e.g. DTG11A and DTG11B),
    see the INST.CAT file for more details on the naming convention. File 3
    contains the heater state (column 2), the reference bridge temperature
    (column 3), and the cable thermocouple temperatures (columns 4-7
    corresponding to TC_1 through TC_4 respectively). The file naming
    convention is as follows:  the first seven characters identify the
    Apollo mission and the heat flow experiment (A17_HFE); the next two
    characters identify the probe, P1 for probe 1, P2 for probe 2; finally,
    the last character before &apos;.tab&apos; gives the file number, 1 through 5.
    The files contained in this data set are:
 
      A17_HFE_P1_1.TAB - Probe 1 upper section gradient bridge DTG11
                         (approximately 130 cm to 177 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P1_2.TAB - Probe 1 lower section gradient bridge DTG12
                         (approximately 185 cm to 233 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P1_3.TAB - Probe 1 heaters and thermocouples
 
      A17_HFE_P1_4.TAB - Probe 1 upper section ring bridge DTR11
                         (approximately 139 cm to 168 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P1_5.TAB - Probe 1 lower section ring bridge DTR12
                         (approximately 194 cm to 224 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P2_1.TAB - Probe 2 upper section gradient bridge DTG21
                         (approximately 131 cm to 178 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P2_2.TAB - Probe 2 lower section gradient bridge DTG22
                         (approximately 186 cm to 234 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P2_3.TAB - Probe 2 heaters and thermocouples
 
      A17_HFE_P2_4.TAB - Probe 2 upper section ring bridge DTR21
                         (approximately 140 cm to 169 cm depth)
 
      A17_HFE_P2_5.TAB - Probe 2 lower section ring bridge DTR22
                         (approximately 195 cm to 225 cm depth)
 
    Two numbering conventions exist in the literature for the
    thermocouples.  We are using the convention that TC14 designates the
    thermocouple at the top of probe 1, TC13 is the cable thermocouple
    closest to probe 1, followed by TC12 and TC11.  Probe 2 would have
    TC24, etc. (Another convention, seen in the Preliminary Science
    Reports, has the probe thermocouple designated as TC11, followed
    successively in the cable by TC14, TC13, and TC12.) The data are kept
    in separate files for each bridge because the measurement times were
    different.
 
    The measurement time intervals for a given sensor would vary over the
    course of its operation, so it should be noted that the time sequences
    in the data sets do not necessarily follow a linear pattern.  In normal
    operating mode a 7.25 minute measurement sequence is used to collect the
    ambient high- and low-sensitivity differential data from the gradient
    sensors and the thermocouple outputs.  The same measurement sequence
    would be used when the heaters were commanded on for the low
    conductivity (0.002 W) mode, with the heaters activated in turn for
    typically 36 hours.  For the high-conductivity (0.5 W) sequence, the
    ring bridge sensors were used and were read every 54 seconds.  This mode
    nominally would last 8 hours.  This mode could also be done without the
    heaters on, with measurements simply being made by the ring bridge
    sensors.  This mode, known as a ring bridge survey, would be used
    approximately every 6 hours at first and less frequently later in the
    experiment.  However, the data archived here only represent subsampled
    data, typically at 57 minute intervals.
 
    The instrument was turned on 12 December 1972 and the first reading
    listed from probe 1 is at 03:05:47 UT.  The first reading listed from
    probe 2 is at 03:08:27 UT.  Please note the heat flow instrument was
    turned on while probe 2 was being inserted into the borestem,
    temperatures recorded only minutes after drilling was completed.
    On 18 February 1977 an anomaly occurred in probe 2 at the 230 cm level.
    The instrument was commanded off along with the other ALSEP experiments
    on 30 September 1977.  The heaters were turned on and off in the low
    power (0.002 W) mode in January 1973 as follows, with the heater
    designation followed in parentheses by the depth of the heater, the date
    and time the heater was turned on, and the date and time the heater was
    turned off, in UT.  For probe 1: H11  (130 cm, 3 Jan. 05:58 - 4 Jan.
    18:00); H12 (177 cm, 14 Jan. 00:03 - 15 Jan. 11:48); H13 (185 cm,
    21 Jan. 00:03 - 22 January 12:31); H14 (233 cm, 8 Jan. 06:21 - 9 Jan.
    16:02).  For probe 2: H21 (131 cm, 5 Jan. 05:18 - 7 Jan. 06:07);
    H22 (178 cm, 16 Jan. 12:06 - 18 Jan. 00:05); H23 (186 cm, 23 Jan.
    00:31 - 24 Jan. 12:30); H24 (234 cm, 10 Jan. 05:59 - 11 Jan. 17:59).
    On 25 January at 18:00 UT H14 was turned on at high power, 0.5 W, and
    was shut off at 20:30 UT.
 
    The nominal data returned from the mission comprised a series of
    measurement times, 8 series of temperature differences for each sensor
    bridge pair (4 from each probe), 8 series of average temperatures for
    each bridge pair, 8 series of cable thermocouple measurements, and a
    series of temperature measurements from the electronics box.  The
    original data were sent to NSSDC written on four 7-track magnetic tapes
    (one for each probe) at 800-bpi by an IBM 1130 Model 2415 tape unit.
    The data were in 32-bit floating point binary and were separated into
    5 files in standard IBM 1130 floating point two-word format.
 
    Programs were written to read these tapes and translate them into
    fixed-width, flat ASCII tables at the NSSDC.  The Apollo 17 tapes
    cover the time span from 03:05:47 UT 12 December 1972 to 22:05:17 UT
    31 December 1974.  The nominal density on the tapes is about one point
    (logical record) per hour, although some samples were done at a much
    lower time resolution.
 
    A reformatting process was applied at NSSDC in June 2005 to the
    Apollo 17 Heat Flow Experiment tapes to produce a set of five data
    tables for each of the two different probes associated with the
    instrument.  All data from a given probe are together in one &apos;file&apos; as
    archived in the original data sets noted above.  Each &apos;file&apos; as
    mentioned in the documentation for the original data set is actually a
    group of physical records that make up only a part of the original
    archived file.  The physical records are written blocked, with 100
    logical records per physical record.  Where the data did not fill a
    complete physical record at the end of a group, the original data had
    zero values inserted to fill out the 100-logical-record physical
    record.
 
    The logical record size (in 4-byte words) is either 3 words (for files
    1, 2, 4, and 5) or 7 words (for file 3).  To make the data easier to
    use, NSSDC separated these groups of physical records into separate
    files (in the usual meaning of a file) by selecting the appropriate
    physical records from the archived data file.  Thus each original
    binary archive file resulted in five new ASCII data files, matching the
    descriptions of the &apos;files&apos; as described in the original data set
    documentation.  In some cases, the number of physical records in the
    &apos;file&apos; was found to be one less than indicated in the documentation.
    The new output files are written in ASCII, unblocked, and the records
    containing only fill values  have been deleted.
 
    In the NSSDC processing program written by H. K. Hills, a physical
    record of binary data was read in, then the order of the four-byte
    words in the record was inverted, making the records advance in
    chronological order (instead of last to first as in the original
    archived data set).  Then the byte order (within a 4-byte word) was
    inverted to put the bytes together properly in the VAX word (because of
    the way the VAX handles input tape records).  Then the sign, mantissa,
    and characteristic of the values were selected as bit strings and moved
    into their own separate computer words, after which the value of each
    data word was computed.  In cases where the input word value was zero,
    the output value was set to a flag value of -9999 (or -9.999000E03).
    The logical three-word records or seven-word records were written out
    in ASCII directly to disk files with no blocking.  Trailing filler
    records of zero values were deleted.
 
    These new ASCII data tables have the records in nominal chronological
    order (i.e., the inverse of the order on the original tapes), but there
    are exceptions where the time of a given point is slightly less than
    the time of the previous point.  The error occurs in the 6th to the 8th
    significant digit of the time.  No such time irregularities were seen
    in most files, but there were numerous such cases in A17_HFE_P1_3.TAB.
    No attempt was made to remove these time discrepancies. There are also
    occasional anomalous temperature readings or data spike errors in
    column 3 (TEMP), which may be a result of telemetry errors, tape
    writing or reading anomalies, or other minor faults.  These errors are
    in most cases very obvious, and we have not attempted to remove the
    anomalous readings.  We note that in general the use of heat flow data
    is for the study of long-term trends, and the preferred way of dealing
    with these anomalous data in most cases would be to ignore them.

      This data set passed an external peer review that was held on
      9 July 2012.
 
      This data set contains only the data delivered by the Principal
      Investigator (PI) of the Heat Flow Experiment.  The PI had already
      processed the data to temperature values.  No further calibration
      information came with the data set.  No original binary data are
      included in this data set.  Raw, uncalibrated heat flow data exist for
      the last year and a half of the Apollo 17 experiment but without the
      proper calibration information the products in this data set supply
      limited information.  We plan to archive the raw, uncalibrated heat
      flow data in the future.
 
      Please be aware that the temperature readings measured by the cable
      thermocouples on the surface are not true surface temperatures due in
      part to the emissivity and heat capacity of the cable.
