    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Raw Packetized Data Records (PDRs) are in the form of raw binary
      telemetry in Consultative Committee for Space Data systems (CCSDS)
      packet format that have been extracted from frames downlinked from
      the instrument.  PDRs have duplications removed and include any
      ancillary information needed to understand what is in a given packet.
      They are retained so that future researchers can reproduce the
      higher-level products if they so desire.  These data will not be
      reformatted or processed further and are delivered to the PDS with
      detached minimal PDS labels.  Because the higher-level products can be
      reprocessed as often as desired, there may be a one-to-many
      relationship a raw data product to a processed data product.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      See individual SIS documents, which are located in the
      DOCUMENT directory, for detailed descriptions of each file
      contained in this data archive.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      A minimal PDS label accompanies each raw data file and gives
      only a high-level description of the content and format.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      The formats of these packets are identical, but their contents differ.
      Each of these packets is composed of five segments:  the CCSDS Primary
      Header which contains packet identification information, the CCSDS
      Secondary Header which contains the packet time stamp, the Science
      Header which contains associated metadata, the Science Data which
      contains the data samples, and a trailer (Other Data) which contains
      transmission information.  Byte values are 8-bits long, Integer values
      are 32-bits long, short (integers) are 16-bits long, and floating
      point values are 32-bit IEEE numbers.  These data only are provided in
      big-endian format.
 
      The science data are time-ordered and consist of Vertical (V) or
      Horizontal (H) polarization channel samples contained within a pulse.
      The packets will contain either H or V channel data, never both in the
      same packet.  The V/H Channel Indicator flag in the Science Header
      indicates if the data are H or V channel.  Data gaps in the derived
      products or breaks in the sequence count field in the primary CCSDS
      packet header would indicate missing packets. Please see documentation
      in the DOCUMENT directory for additional information on the data files
      and their format.
 
      These data are stored in the DATA/SAR/&lt;orbit&gt;/RAW directory on
      archival volumes. File names are described in MRFLRO_DP_SIS.PDF.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Each raw science product is accompanied by a text metadata file
      that contains the parameters that describe the state the instrument
      was in at the time of data collection and location and timing
      information about the data set.  This file is referenced in the
      PDS label associated with the science data product.
 
 
    Housekeeping Data
    =================
      Instrument housekeeping data is included with this data set.  These
      data are provided in text files in comma separated value (CSV)
      spreadsheet-type format.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Raw data products are not dependent on definition of a
      coordinate system.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      No software is included with this archival data set.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      These products are delivered on a hard-drive or by ftp and
      not on a specific formatted medium.

Overview
=========
The Mini-RF EDR data are the least processed data set released for the
Mini-RF instrument.  Data presented here are an accurate representation
of the Mini-RF data as received from the spacecraft, with no Doppler or
spatial processing.
 
Review
======
The Mini-RF EDR was reviewed internally by the Mini-RF team prior to release
to the PDS.  PDS also performed an external review of the Mini-RF EDR.
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
Data reported are the minimally processed data received from the spacecraft
during five mission phases: Launch, Cruise, Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition,
Commissioning, and Exploration_Mission.  These mission phases are defined as:
 
    Start time               End time
    Phase Name               Date (DOY)               Date (DOY)
    -----------------        ----------------         ----------------
    LAUNCH                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        18 Jun 2009 (169)
    CRUISE                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    LUNAR ORBIT ACQUISITION  23 Jun 2009 (174)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    COMMISSIONING            23 Jun 2009 (174)        14 Sep 2009 (257)
    NOMINAL MISSION          15 Sep 2009 (258)        14 Sep 2010 (257)
    SCIENCE MISSION          15 Sep 2010 (258)        14 Sep 2012 (258)
 
No Mini-RF data were collected during Launch, Cruise, or
Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition phases. The Mini-RF collected data during each of
the other two mission phases. During these planned operational periods, the
Mini-RF functioned nominally and the data quality was good.
 
A S-Band receive calibration test was conducted on 20 August, 2009.  S-Band
transmit calibration tests were conducted on 22-23 August, 2009.  These
calibrations permit the characterization of both transmit polarization purity
as well as determining how precisely polarization can be measured by the
instrument.
 
Communications demonstration.  Mini-RF experiments to demonstrate half-duplex
communications were conducted on 16 August and 20 August, 2009.
 
The Mini-RF began collecting data over the lunar south polar region 13 July
2009 to support LCROSS targeting by characterizing the surfaces of
permanently shadowed regions.  This data collection phase continued until the
LCROSS impact on 9 October. 2009.
 
From Oct 14 through Dec. 17, Mini-RF was largely restricted to collecting
data over non-polar sites that lie equatorward of 63 degrees latitude North
and South.
 
Since 26 December 2010, the Mini-RF instrument has not transmitted the RF
energy required to create radar images of the lunar surface. The Mini-RF team
looked at the initial 13 collects attempted from that date forward and noted
that in all but one collect the data appeared bad, looking like noise.  The
team continued to attempt data collections at a reduced rate (about 1 collect
per day) through January 23, 2011. Products included in this data set made
from data collected after 26 December 2010 do not contain scientifically
useful data.
 
 
Limitations
===========
This data set is minimally processed data.  The data are received from the
spacecraft telemetry, ingested into the LRO Missions Operations Center (MOC),
and then transferred to the APL Payload Operations Center (POC).
