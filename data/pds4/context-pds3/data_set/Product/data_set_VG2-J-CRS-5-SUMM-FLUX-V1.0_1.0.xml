      (The following description has been excerpted from
      [NSSDCCRS1979])
 
      As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
      designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B]. It consists
      of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy
      Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET). The
      detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster)
      and long electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low
      power consumption and good stability. Normally, the data are
      primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]
      and E) pulse-height information about individual events.
      Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and
      Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
      single detectors and various coincidence rates. In inter-
      planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence
      with the primary detectors to reduce the background from
      high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the
      telescopes. These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian
      magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became
      high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired
      counts. Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were
      sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating
      particles, was small.
 
      The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained
      with the LET. The thicknesses of individual solid-state
      detectors in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen
      such that, even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made,
      at most, a very minor contribution to the proton counting
      rates [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972]. Dead time corrections and accidental
      coincidences were small (&lt; 20%) throughout most of the
      magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt; 50%) at flux maxima
      within 40 R[J] Of Jupiter. Data have been included in this
      package for those periods when the corrections are less than
      ~ 50% and can be corrected by the user with the dead time
      appropriate to the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec). The high
      counting rates, however, caused some baseline shift which may
      have raised proton thresholds significantly. In the inner
      magnetosphere, the L[2] counting rate was still useful because
      it never rolled over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV
      protons penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons
      penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2 spectrum,
      the two groups would make comparable contributions; but in the
      magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV
      [MCDONALDETAL1979], the contribution from protons penetrating
      the shield would be only 3 to 14%.
 
      The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-
      anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8
      MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution
      (~10^-3). Corrections are required for dead time losses in
      L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence
      losses from L[4]. Data are given only for periods when these
      corrections are relatively small. In addition to the rates
      listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]
      and L[3] was measured for individual particles. For protons,
      this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons
      can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,
      their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly
      reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a
      small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and
      statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged
      over a period of one hour.
 
      HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-
      height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one
      another during periods of high counting rates. To prevent such
      an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,
      the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each
      192 seconds long. Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on
      at a time. LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]
      coincidence requirements. The TET was cycled through various
      coincidence conditions, including singles from the front
      detectors. At the expense of some time resolution, this
      procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer
      magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage
      through the magnetotail region.
 
      Some of the published results from this experiment required
      extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences
      and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];
      [SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]). These corrections can be
      applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of
      the environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot
      be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer
      programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not
      included in the Data Center submission. The scientists on the
      CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests
      if the desired information can be extracted from the data.
 
      Description of the Data
      -----------------------
      (1) LD1 RATE gives the nominal &gt; 0.43-MeV proton flux cm^-2
          s^-1 sr^-1. This rate includes all particles which pass
          through a 0.8 mg/cm^2 aluminum foil and deposits more than
          220 keV in a 34.6 [micron] Si detector on Voyager 1 (209
          keV, 33.9 [microns] on Voyager 2) Therefore, heavy ions,
          such as oxygen and sulfur are also detected; however, their
          contribution is believed to be relatively small. Only a
          small percentage of the pulses in this detector are larger
          than the maximum energy that can be deposited by a proton.
          Heavy ions would produce such large pulses, unless their
          energy spectra were much steeper than the proton spectrum.
          The true flux, F[t], can be calculated from the data:
 
                                     F
                      F[t]  = ----------------
                              1 - 1.26x10^-4 F
 
          and corrections are small for F &lt; 1000 cm^-2 s^-1.
 
      (2) LD2 RATE is not suitable for an absolute flux determination
          and is given in counters per s. The detector responds to
          protons and ions that penetrate either (a) 0.8 mg/cm^2 Al
          plus 8.0 mg/cm^2 Si and lose at least 200 keV in a 35
          [micron] Si detector (1.8 to 13 MeV) or (b) pass through
          &gt; 140 mg/cm^2 Al. For an E^-2 proton spectrum, the
          contributions from (a) and (b) would be about equal;
          however, the proton spectrum is substantially softer
          throughout most of the magnetosphere and the detector
          should respond primarily to (a). Dead time corrections
          are given by
 
                                    R
                     R[t]  = ----------------
                             1 - 2.55x10^-5 R
 
          where R is the count rate in counts/s. Thus, correction to
          the supplied data are small for R &lt; 4000 c/sec, but become
          80 large in the middle magnetosphere that the magnitude of
          even relative intensity changes becomes uncertain.
 
      (3) LD L[1].L[2]. L[4]. SL COINCIDENCE RATE gives the total
          proton flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) between ~ 1.8 and ~ 8.1 MeV
          with a small admixture of alpha particles. Accidental
          coincidences become substantial at higher rates and the
          flux derived from pulse-height analysis should be used if
          accuracy is desired.
 
      (4) LDTRP RATE gives proton flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) between
          3.0 and 8.0 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution
          (L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidences are required).
 
      (5) IBS4E RATE gives the electron flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) for
          electrons with a range between 4 and 10 mm in Si; this
          corresponds approximately to the energy range of 2.6-5.1
          MeV. Accidental coincidence and dead time corrections are
          generally small in the magnetotail and have not been
          applied to these data. Because of differences between
          Voyager 1 and 2, we give the average rate for HET I and II
          for Voyager 1 and the HET I rate for Voyager 2.
 
      (6) IBS3E RATE is the same as (5); but the electron range
          falls between 10 and 16 mm of Si, or approximately 5.1-8
          MeV.
 
      (7) IBS2E RATE is the same as (5); but the electron range
          falls between 16 and 22 mm of Si, or approximately 8-12
          MeV.
 
      (8) D4L RATE is not suitable for an absolute electron flux
          determination. This counting rate includes all pulses from
          detector D[4] of TET which exceed 0.5 MeV. The shielding
          varies with direction of incidence but is at least 1.2 cm
          of Si. In the Jovian environment, the detector responds
          primarily to electrons with energies above ~ 6 MeV. The
          D[4]L rate is useful primarily for determining relative
          changes in the high-energy electron flux. This rate has a
          high background from the RTG. Where needed, the dead time
          corrections should be applied as to the LD[2] rate ([tau]
          ~ 2.55x10^-5 s).
 
      (9) Pulse-height Analyzed Proton Flux (FPHA) is derived from a
          [Delta]E vs. E analysis of pulses from L[1], L[2] and L[3]
          of LET and gives the average proton flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1
          MeV^-1) in six energy channels. Where required, a
          correction should be applied for the dead time in LD1 as
          follows:
 
                                        FPHA
                      FPHA[t]  = -------------------
                                 1 - 1.26x10^-4 FLD1
 
          where FPHA is the listed flux of this rate (9) and FLD1 is
          the flux given in rate 1. FPHA gives the most accurate
          value of the proton flux available from this experiment;
          however, the counting statistics are poorer than for the
          other rates because of limited sampling. Fluxes derived
          from rate 3 (LD) which cover the same energy range as FPHA
          will be higher because of poorer definition of the energy
          threshold, accidental coincidences and a variable, but
          small, background contribution.
