  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains raw calibration and test images acquired by the
    Deep Impact Medium Resolution Instrument Visible CCD (MRI) during the
    cruise phase of the mission.  These observations were used for optical
    and autonomous navigation (NAV) of the flyby spacecraft.  These data
    were collected from 14 January to 25 April 2005.  Test images of comet
    9P/Tempel 1 were acquired on 25 April.
 
    Software on board the flyby spacecraft used the optical navigation
    (OpNav) and autonomous navigation (AutoNav) images to compute the
    brightness centroid of the target body for trajectory corrections.
    Optical navigation was used for the cruise phase and most of the
    encounter phase, until two hours before impact when the AutoNav
    system took control of the flyby spacecraft in preparation for
    impact imaging.  For more information about the AutoNav system,
    see Mastrodemos, et. al (2005) [MASTRODEMOSETAL2005].
 
     A NAV observation consisted of one or more packets of data, each
    containing an 80-byte header plus a rectangle of image data called a
    &apos;&apos;snip&apos;&apos;, cropped from a full-frame image.  Pixels outside the snips
    were not returned.  The Deep Impact Science Data Center (SDC) at
    Cornell University, used the packets for one observation to
    reconstruct a raw, full-frame image of 1008 by 1008 pixels.  Pixels
    outside the snips were set to a value of zero with one common header.
    Locations of the snips within the frame were not captured by the
    data pipeline.  Further details about these images are included in
    the processing section below.
 
    Raw NAV images were grouped into daily directories by mid-observation
    date.  A list of the NAV images in the data set is provided here:

    Related Data Sets
    -----------------
      The following PDS data sets are related to this one:
 
      DIF-C-MRI-2-NAV-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0  : Raw MRI NAV encounter data
      DIF-C-MRI-3-NAV-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0  : Calibrated MRI NAV enctr data
      DI-C-SPICE-6-V1.0                  : SPICE kernels
 
      The related Deep Impact science data sets are:
 
      DIF-CAL-MRI-2-9P-CRUISE-V1.0       : Raw MRI cruise data
      DIF-C-MRI-2-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0      : Raw MRI encounter data
      DIF-C-MRI-3/4-9P-ENCOUNTER-V2.0    : Calibrated MRI encounter data
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    The FITS images in this data set were created by the Deep Impact
    Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University and were assembled
    from raw NAV snips received from the flyby spacecraft.  The NAV images
    report, listed above in the recommended reading section, discusses how
    the NAV data were processed into raw images.  A summary is provided
    here.
 
    NAV images were typically acquired during sequences designed to gather
    science data.  The major difference between a science and NAV image
    was that a NAV observation was made of one or more packets of data,
    each containing an 80-byte header plus a rectangle of image data
    called a &apos;&apos;snip&apos;&apos;.  Because the snips were cropped from a full-frame
    image, not all pixels were returned in many cases.  However, some
    images were returned in full as a single snip of 1008 by 1008 pixels.
 
    Because one raw NAV observation was received as one or more snips,
    the SDC reconstructed a full frame of 1008 by 1008 pixels from the
    snips and stored the results as raw a FITS file.  Since the raw NAV
    snips excluded the serial- and parallel-overclock pixels around the
    edges of the 1024 by 1024 array, these areas were not added to the
    reconstructed, raw frames.  Also, pixels not returned were set to
    a value of zero in the raw FITS images.
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files was
      DxMeeeeeee_yyyydddhhmmssuuu.LBL or FIT, where:
 
        D       : Deep Impact
        x       : Image usage (A for AutoNav or O for OpNav)
        M       : MRI instrument
        eeeeeee : Exposure ID, same as for science data; image number
                  within an exposure ID was always 1 of 1
        yyyy    : Ground-received time (GRT) year
        ddd     : GRT day of year
        hhmmss  : GRT hours, minutes, and seconds
        uuu     : Suffix to provide uniqueness when two images were
                  acquired or processed within the same second
 
      Some images were downloaded more than once and processed
      by the SDC.  For this case, each version of a raw image was
      included in this data set.  For multiple downloads of one
      image, the exposure IDs in the file names are identical
      but the GRTs are different.
 
 
    FITS CCD Images
    ---------------
      The two-dimensional, visible CCD images in this data set are in FITS
      format.  The primary data array contains the CCD image.  Each FITS
      file is accompanied by a detached PDS label.  The document about NAV
      images provides a more detailed description of the image format.
 
      Although a lossless compression algorithm was available, it was
      not used during flight.  Therefore, all raw NAV FITS images in
      this data set are uncompressed (i.e., never compressed on board
      the spacecraft).
 
 
    Target Name and Description
    ---------------------------
      The TARGET_NAME keyword in the data labels was set to the intended
      target, such as &apos;Calibration&apos;.  The TARGET_DESC keyword provides
      the name of the specific calibration target, such as &apos;NGC 3114&apos;.
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;&apos;As Seen By Observer&apos;&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the image labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = &apos;UP&apos;
 
      This topic is discussed in detail in the &apos;Quadrant Nomenclature&apos;
      section of the &apos;Deep Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; document.
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw image data are in units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Imaging Modes and Filters
    ------------------------
      The unbinned, full-frame, instrument mode 1 was always used for NAV
      images.  Also, the only filters used were the two clear filters:  1
      or 6, both centered at 650 nanometers.  However, the exact filter
      was not known when the raw FITS images were created.  Therefore, the
      filter-related keywords in the PDS labels are set to UNK (unknown).
      The exact filter was determined later during the pre-processing of
      raw NAV data for the calibration pipeline.
 
      For descriptions of the imaging modes and filters, please see
      the Deep Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005].
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      Although the time to impact was not calculated for the NAV data,
      the estimated time of impact at the flyby spacecraft was UTC
      05:44:34.265 on 4 Jul 2005.  This is based on the conclusions
      presented in the spacecraft clock correlation report provided
      on the DI Documentation volume.
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE in the data labels specified the
      the direction of ecliptic north as projected onto the image plane.
      It is measured from the &apos;upward&apos; direction, clockwise to the
      direction toward ecliptic north when the image is displayed as
      defined by the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION
      keywords.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the
      proper geometric information for the target of choice in many
      cases.  When these parameters could not be computed, the
      corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were set to a
      value of unknown (UNK).  Geometry-related keywords for most
      calibration targets were set to UNK.
 
      Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
      the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
      and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
      calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
      earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
      left the target.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second discrepancy between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations.  These improved kernels were included in the
      DI SPICE data set and were used to calculate the geometric
      parameters in the PDS data labels.  For more information about
      this discrepancy, please see the spacecraft clock correlation
      report provided on the DI documentation volume, DIDOC_0001.
 
      The SPICE kernels used to calculated the geometric parameters are
      provided by the SPICE_FILE_NAME keyword in the PDS data labels.  The
      kernels were listed in the order they were loaded into memory for
      processing.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the DI SPICE data set archived in the PDS.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep
    Impact document volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used by the science team to calibrate the NAV
    images of 9P/Tempel 1.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set was peer-reviewed in November 2006 and was accepted
    for the PDS archive pending resolution of liens (completed in June
    2007).
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All expected data were received on the ground and are included in
    this data set.  There are gaps in the exposure IDs in some daily
    data directories because NAV frames were interspersed with science
    frames.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    1/3 Pixel Gap
    -------------
      There is a 1/3-pixel, horizontal gap for a clocking phase between
      the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  It was inserted by the
      manufacturer to facilitate the simultaneous upward and downward
      reading of the upper and lower quadrants.  The gap causes a
      10 percent reduction in the sensitivity of the two central rows
      (i.e., one row immediately above the gap and one below it).
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      For some raw NAV images, there is little contrast between the
      snips and the surrounding &apos;&apos;missing&apos;&apos; pixels.  To more easily
      view the snip(s) within a 1008x1008-pixel raw NAV FITS image,
      use a histogram equalization to scale the image for display.
