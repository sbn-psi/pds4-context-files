  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The data set consists of ground-based images of comet 19P/Borrelly in the
    R filter taken at the Kitt Peak 2.1m for three nights from September
    21-23, 2001, bracketing the Deep Space 1 encounter. The Kitt Peak 2.1m
    telescope at f/7.5 with the T2KA (2kx2k) chip was used for all
    observations. The Harris broad band R filter optimized for the Landolt
    broad band colors was used. The Harris R filter is very close to the
    Cousins R filter. All nights were photometric. All objects were tracked at
    the sidereal rate.
    Raw, as well as reduced images are included. Corresponding calibration
    frames (dome flats and bias frames) are included. Twilight flats are
    included for September 23 but were not used in our reduction.
    All the data were trimmed, bias subtracted and flat fielded with the dome
    flats. Dithered object frames were combined and smoothed. These frames
    were used as illumination correction as the illumination for the dark sky
    is different from that of the white spot in the dome. The resulting
    reduced images are smaller than the raw images due to the trimming.
 
    Landolt standard fields PG0231+051 and PG22213-006 (Landolt 1992) are
    available with tables listing the centers (x,y) of the standard stars in
    the reduced images. The centers of comet 19P/Borrelly are also tabulated
    for the reduced images. Note that the origin in the frames is (1,1), not
    (0,0).
 
    All the standard stars were measured with the same aperture with a
    diameter of 30 pixels (approximately 9&apos;). The size of the aperture is
    large enough to include 99% of the measured flux of the star and is at
    least 3 times larger than the seeing.
 
    As the nights were photometric, tables relating the counts/second of
    individual images to calibrated flux density units (f) are also included.
 
 
    f = counts/sec * f0 * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP-coeff*airmass))
 
    where m0=25mag is the zero point offset of the magnitude scale, ZP the
    zero point, coeff the airmass coefficient, and counts/sec is the DN value
    read from the image / exposure time.
 
    Therefore
 
    f = DN value * f0 * conversion factor
 
    where the conversion factor is
     1/exptime * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP-coeff*airmass))
 
    These conversion factors are given in tables and
    f0=2.23E-09 erg s^-1 cm^-2 Angstrom^-1  for the R-band (converted from
    Bessel 1989). The error in f0 is 0.02E-09 due to the difference in
    effective wavelength between the Cousins Filter and the Harris filter. The
    filter response curves however look very similar to each other.
 
    The data were used in part to put constraints on the direction of the
    angular momentum vector (Samarasinha and Mueller 2002).
    Although the data were not explicitly taken to support the Deep Space 1
    mission, they complement the spacecraft data as well as other space- and
    ground-based data for comet 19P/Borrelly.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The conversion factors to relate counts to flux densities have an
    error of about 2E-13
 
    The error in f0 is 0.02E-09 due to the difference in the effective
    wavelength between the Cousins Filter and the Harris filter. The filter
    response curves however look very similar to each other.
