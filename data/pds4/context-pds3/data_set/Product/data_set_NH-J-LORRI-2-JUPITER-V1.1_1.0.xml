    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This data set contains Raw data taken by New Horizons
        Long Range Reconnaissance Imager
      instrument during the JUPITER mission phase.
 
      Science observations for the Jupiter Phase began with
      observations of Jupiter on 2007 January 8 and ended on 2007
      March 7 with observations of Himalia, a Jovian irregular
      satellite. LORRI acquired extensive observations of the Jovian
      system during this time. Images of the Jovian atmosphere and
      clouds included full disk rotation movies, as well as resolved
      images of selected features like the Great Red Spot and the
      Little Red Spot. An imaging campaign was executed to observe the
      Jovian ring system and associated small satellites. Observing
      campaigns were also performed to image each of the Galilean
      satellites, but with particular attention to Io under both
      sunlit and eclipse conditions, and with eclipse observations of
      both Europa and Ganymede. Images were also acquired of the small
      irregular satellites Elara and Himalia. On 2007 January 10,
      LORRI observed the Jovian irregular satellite Callirrhoe as part
      of an Optical Navigation test of relative control mode (RCM),
      which is a special guidance and control mode to be used for the
      initial acquisition of a KBO, if an extended mission is
      approved. On 2007 February 21 LORRI executed a mosaic centered
      on Jupiter to obtain scattered light data. LORRI took a series
      of images on 2007 February 28 while the spacecraft was scanned
      across Jupiter&apos;s terminator, in an attempt to acquire in-flight
      flat field measurements.
 
      Every observation provided in this data set was taken as a part of a
      particular sequence.  A list of these sequences follows:
 
      Sequence IDs &amp; start times (end times are the start times
      of the following Sequence IDs) for the LORRI instrument
      during the JUPITER phase of the New Horizons Mission

      For the list of observations and their parameters, refer to
      the data set index table (typically INDEX.TAB &amp; CUMINDEX.TAB,
      initially in the /INDEX/ area of the data set).
 
 
    Time
    ====
 
      There are several time systems, or units, in use in this dataset:
      New Horizons spacecraft MET (Mission Event Time or Mission Elapsed
      Time), UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), and TDB Barycentric
      Dynamical Time.
 
      This section will give a summary description of the relationship
      between these time systems.  For a complete explanation of these
      time systems the reader is referred to the documentation
      distributed with the NAIF/SPICE toolkit from the NAIF PDS node.
 
      The most common time unit associated with the data is is the
      spacecraft MET.  MET is a 32-bit counter on the New Horizons
      spacecraft that runs at a rate of about one increment per second
      starting from a value of zero at
 
        19.January, 2006 18:08:02 UTC
 
      or
 
        JD2453755.256337 TDB.
 
      The leapsecond adjustment (DELTA_ET = ET - UTC) over this dataset
      is 65.184s.
 
      The data labels for any given product in this dataset usually
      contain at least one pair of common UTC and MET representations
      of the time at the middle of the observation.  Other portions
      of the products, for example tables of data taken over periods
      of up to a day or more, will only have the MET time associated
      with a given row of the table.
 
      For the data user&apos;s use in interpreting these times, a reasonable
      approximation (+/- 1s) of the conversion between Julian Day (TDB)
      and MET is as follows:
 
        JD TDB = 2453755.256337 + ( MET / 86399.9998693 )
 
      For more accurate calculations the reader is referred to the
      NAIF/SPICE documentation as mentioned above.
 
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The data in this data set were created by a software data
      processing pipeline on the Science Operation Center (SOC) at
      the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), Department of Space Studies.
      This SOC pipeline assembled data as FITS files from raw telemetry
      packets sent down by the spacecraft and populated the data labels
      with housekeeping and engineering values, and computed geometry
      parameters using SPICE kernels. The pipeline did not resample
      the data.
 
 
    Data
    ====
 
      The observations in this data set are stored in data files using
      standard Flexible Image Transport Sytem (FITS) format.  Each FITS
      file has a corresponding detached PDS label file, named according
      to a common convention.  The FITS files have image and/or table
      extensions; see the PDS label plus the DOCUMENT files for a
      description of these extensions and their contents.

      Visit Description, Visit Number, and Target in the Data Labels
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
 
        The observation sequences were defined in Science Activity
        Planning (SAP) documents, and grouped by Visit Description and
        Visit Number.  The SAPs are spreadsheets with one Visit Description
        &amp; Number per row.  A nominal target is also included on each row
        and included in the data labels, but does not always match with the
        TARGET_NAME field&apos;s value in the data labels.  In some cases, the
        target was designated as RA,DEC pointing values in the form
        ``RADEC=123.45,-12.34&apos;&apos; indicating Right Ascension and Declination,
        in degrees, of the target from the spacecraft in the Earth
        Equatorial J2000 inertial reference frame.  This indicates either
        that the target was either a star, or that the target&apos;s ephemeris
        was not loaded into the spacecraft&apos;s attitude and control system
        which in turn meant the spacecraft could not be pointed at the
        target by a body identifier and an inertial pointing value had to
        be specified as Right Ascension and Declination values.  The PDS
        standards do not allow putting a value like RADEC=... in the PDS
        TARGET_NAME keyword&apos;s value; in those cases the PDS TARGET_NAME
        value is set to CALIBRATION.
 
 
      Unresolved Liens on the Data
      ----------------------------
 
        None exist at the present time.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      The geometry items included in the data labels were computed
      using the SPICE kernels archived in the New Horizons SPICE
      data set, NH-X-SPICE-6-JUPITER-V1.0.
 
 
    Reference Frame
    ===============
 
 
      Geometric Parameter Reference Frame
      -----------------------------------
        Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EMEJ2000) is the
        inertial reference frame used to specify observational geometry
        items provided in the data labels.  Geometric parameters are based
        on best available SPICE data at time of data creation.
 
 
      Epoch of Geometric Parameters
      -----------------------------
        All geometric parameters provided in the data labels were
        computed at the epoch midway between the START_TIME and
        STOP_TIME label fields.
 
 
 
    Software
    ========
 
      The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format
      with PDS labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided
      and commercial programs. For this reason no special software is
      provided with this data set.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      During the processing of the data in preparation for
      delivery with this volume, the packet data associated with each
      observation were used only if they passed a rigorous verification
      process including standard checksums.
 
      In addition, raw (Level 2) observation data for which adequate
      contemporary housekeeping and other ancillary data are not available
      are not reduced to calibrated (Level 3) data.  This issue is raised
      here to explain why some data products in the raw data set,
 
        NH-J-LORRI-2-JUPITER-V1.1,
 
      do not have corresponding data products in the calibrated data set,
 
        NH-J-LORRI-3-JUPITER-V1.1.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      The data have been reviewed and validated by the instrument team
      members, as well as by SOC personnel.
 
 
 
     LORRI updates for Data Sets V1.1
     ================================
 
 
 
       Improvements to geometry &amp; timing in data header sections
       ---------------------------------------------------------
 
         The data pipeline re-ran the data with updated SPICE files; SPICE
         files contain information relating to geometry and timing of
         observations.  This may have changed values in the data PDS
         labels and the data files&apos; FITS header section (referred to as
         OBJECT *_HEADER in the PDS labels), but not the data in those files.
 
 
       Improvements to ancillary files
       -------------------------------
 
         Some of the supporting files, mainly in the /DOCUMENT/
         subdirectory hierarchy, have been updated for content
         and for readability.  The primary file for which this
         was done was the SOC Instrument Interface Control
         Document (often referred to as the SOC Instrument ICD).
