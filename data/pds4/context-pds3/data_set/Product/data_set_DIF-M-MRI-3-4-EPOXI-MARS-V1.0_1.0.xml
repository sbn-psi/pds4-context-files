  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in
    this data set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline,
    maintained by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell
    University.  For each CCD image, the pipeline generates two types of
    calibrated products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the
        mnemonic &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be
        reversible because the calibration steps can be backed out to
        return to the original, raw data numbers.  A RADREV image can
        be converted to unitless I-over-F by multiplying by the value
        assigned to the DATA_TO_IOVERF_MULTIPLIER keyword in the PDS
        label.  Alternatively, a RADREV image can be converted from
        radiance units to calibrated data numbers by multiplying by the
        value assigned to the DATA_TO_DN_MULTIPLIER in the PDS label.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the
        mnemonic &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be
        irreversible because the calibration steps, such as smoothing
        over bad pixels, cannot easily be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.  A RAD image can be converted
        to unitless I-over-F by multiplying by the value assigned to
        the DATA_TO_IOVERF_MULTIPLIER keyword in the PDS label.
        Alternatively, a RAD image can be converted from radiance units to
        calibrated data numbers by multiplying by the value assigned to
        the DATA_TO_DN_MULTIPLIER in the PDS label (though interpolated
        pixels will not be real data).
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes on the raw
    MRI FITS data to produce the RADREV and RAD products found in this
    data set:
 
      - Decompression of compressed images (Mars images were not
        compressed)
      - Correction for bias
      - Subtraction of a dark frame
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk
      - Application of a normalized flat field
      - Removal of CCD transfer smear
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV)
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust
      - Calculation of multiplicative factors to convert a RADREV or RAD
        image to I-over-F
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps (missing pixels were identified when the raw FITS files
        were created).
 
    The pipeline also created a FITS image extension for a signal-to-noise
    ratio map.  The calibration steps and files applied to each raw image
    are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS data
    label. For a detailed discussion of the calibration pipeline and the
    resulting data, see the Deep Impact instrument calibration document
    and the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated MRI image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit
      contains the two-dimensional CCD image which is followed by two
      image extensions that are two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel maps
      providing additional information about the CCD image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data label defines the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      For more information about the FITS primary image and the extensions,
      refer to the Deep Impact instrument calibration document or the EPOXI
      SIS document
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in a
      data label.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      MVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;MV&apos; identifies the MRI
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 8
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 1000000, the
      first FITS file name would be MV09112011_1000000_001_RR.FIT and the
      last would be MV09112011_1000000_001_008_RR.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All data products in this data set were never compressed.  If the
      associated raw data products was compressed on board the flyby
      spacecraft (and thus received on the ground and archived as
      compressed) then the calibration pipeline uses one of four 8-bit
      lookup tables to decompress the raw image.  However, the Mars
      images acquired acquired during the time period covered by this data
      set were never compressed.  For more information about this topic,
      see the image compression section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration documents.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS
      has a brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of MRI to the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the relative boresight alignments section of the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      The calibrated RADREV and RAD image data have units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      One image mode was used for all MRI Mars observations:
 
                     X-Size  Y-Size
        Mode Name    (pix)   (pix)   Comments
        ---- ------  ------  ------  ---------------------------------------
          2  SF1       512    512    Sub-frame, shuttered
 
      All modes are unbinned.  For a thorough description of the imaging
      modes, please see the Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a
      brief discussion of this topic.
 
      Most image modes have a set of bias overclock rows and columns,
      located around the edges of the image array.  All overclock pixels
      were excluded from the calculation of the values for MINIMUM,
      MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.  These
      overclock areas described in the Deep Impact instruments document
      and the Deep Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
    Filters
    -------
      One filter was used for all MRI Mars observations:
 
        Filter         Center Width
        #  Name        (nm)   (nm)   Comments
        -  ----------  -----  -----  -------------------------------
        4  RED          750    100   For context
 
      For more information about the filters, see the Deep Impact
      instruments document or the Deep Impact instrument calibration
      document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Mars-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For Mars observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The UTC and geometry values included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    products were generated.  The final, best SPICE kernels will be posted
    on the NAIF/SPICE web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ and
    archived in the PDS data set DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0 after the end
    of the EPOXI mission.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels, unless specified otherwise (e.g,
    SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    data set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this data set were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The PDS Small Bodies Node held a peer review for this data set on
    29 September 2010.  The reviewers certified this data set for
    scientific use and archiving on 29 September 2010.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this data set.  All Mars observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernel (SCLK) used to compute UTC
      values in the data labels and FITS headers has known discontinuities
      of up to a second.  If time and funding permit, the EPOXI project
      will provide more precise times after the mission ends.
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the MRI CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are biased during
      integration so that the centers of the two halves are apparently
      1/6 pixel closer to the center, and the two boundary rows show a
      decrease in sensitivity of 1/6.  Reconstructed image files space
      all lines evenly, so the true image is erroneously vertically
      pushed apart by 1/3 pixel at its center in these reconstructions.
      When making science measurements from MRI images, one must
      therefore be very careful to properly account for the two flaws
      introduced by the apparently narrow central lines on the CCD - a
      geometric error that separates the image by an extra 1/3 pixel at
      the horizontal quadrant boundary, and 2) insertion of extra total
      radiance into calibrated images due to the flat-field correction,
      which corrects for an apparent radiance deficit in the two central
      rows because of the smaller number of photons actually incident on
      those rows.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels are included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document or the EPOXI SIS document.
