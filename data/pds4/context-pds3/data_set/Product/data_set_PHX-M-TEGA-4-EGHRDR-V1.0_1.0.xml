    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is designed to analyze
      ~50 mg of fine grained Martian soil or rock fragments. TEGA
      consists of four basic components: a soil delivery system,
      an oven/calorimeter thermal analyzer (TA), a gas storage and
      handling system, and a mass spectrometer acting as an
      evolved-gas analyzer (EGA). A full description of the TEGA
      instrument can be found in [BOYNTONETAL2008].
 
      The data set PHX MARS THERMAL EVOLVED GAS ANALYZER 3 RDR
      is a time series collection of TA, EGA, engineering, and
      commanding measurements from the TEGA aboard the Mars Phoenix
      Lander. The RDR data are converted from the EDR raw values to
      scientifically useful data including physical units. Data types
      included in this data set are engineering data, calorimeter data
      from the TA,sweep mode EGA data, and mass hopping mode EGA data.
      Data are sorted by time, with each data file containing one
      measurement day&apos;s worth of data from midnight to midnight UTC.
 
      TEGA is designed to analyze 8 individual Martian regolith
      samples, one sample in each of the eight single use ovens.
      The EGA portion of the instrument will not only analyze the
      gases evolved from the samples heated in the ovens, but will
      also analyzed samples of the Martian atmosphere.
 
      TEGA is expected to operate for 45 days. During operations
      science, engineering and housekeeping data are downloaded from
      the lander by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) into the
      Telemetry Data System(TDS). The TDS sends data to a process
      that translates data packets and
      examines instrument health via messages. Data are output to a
      spooler that passes them to the University of Arizona (UA)
      database ingest process. The ingest process inputs raw data
      into the UA database. Data are retrieved from the UA database
      to build the TEGA RDR data products.
 
      The TEGA RDR data set is intended to be the first reduced data
      product for the TEGA instrument. It should be useful to those
      scientists who are experienced in calorimetry and mass
      spectrometry.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The TEGA RDR data set is composed of four data types. The
      objective of compiling the TEGA RDR is to create a record of
      of data that has been converted to scientifically useful
      physical units and has been combined with useful calibration
      information. The following paragraphs discuss the parameters of
      interest in each of the data types.
 
      SCRDR
      -----
        The SC data are time series records taken over the course
        of a measurement day. Data files are labeled with the date.
        Individual records are a single data collection interval. SC
        data are the science data produced by the TA.
 
      EGSRDR
      ------
        The EGA data are time series records taken over the course of
        a measurement day. Data files are labeled with the date.
        Individual records are a single data collection interval.
        EGA data are the science data produced by the EGA mass
        spectrometer in sweep mode.
 
      EGHRDR
      ------
        The EGH data are time series records taken over the course of
        a measurement day. Data files are labeled with the date.
        Individual records are a single data collection interval. EGH
        data are the science data produced by the EGA mass
        spectrometer in mass hopping mode.
 
      ENGRDR
      ------
        The Engineering data are time series records for each
        engineering parameter taken over the course of a measurement
        day. Data files are grouped in the ENG folder and are labeled
        with the engineering parameter name. Individual records are a
        single data collection interval that is variable in duration.
        Engineering values are reported by parameter name and include
        collection time, and parameter value. In general,
        temperatures are reported in Celsius, currents in milliamps,
        and potentials in volts. The ENGRDR label file is the
        definitive source for the units of measure. Engineering
        values are specific monitor values recorded by TEGA.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      TEGA data (both science and engineering) are downloaded from
      the Phoenix Mars Lander by JPL into the Telemetry Data System
      (TDS). The TDS sends the data to a process called TEGA_tl, that
      translates GRS packets from any source to any destination and
      examines instrument health via messages. The data are checked
      for packet types, header information, messages, or errors.
      Data are output to a spooler, which passes data to the UA
      database ingestion process. The ingestion process inputs raw
      telemetry data into the database.
 
      A function reads the data header to get the total number of
      bytes in the packet, and the sequence bytes. The rest of the
      packet is then read. The data type, read from the common header,
      is returned, determining the next step in the processing. One
      of a number of different procedures is run to insert packet
      data into the appropriate database tables. If the data type
      returned is less than or equal to 0 an error message is
      returned stating that the packet was not inserted.
 
      The initialization of the ingestion process also sets up the
      necessary connections to the SPICE kernel information
      (Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) system
      designed to provide scientists with ancillary observation
      geometry data useful in interpretation of science instrument
      observations returned from planetary spacecraft), the database,
      and the input data. The appropriate SPICE kernels are loaded
      and opened, and a connection is initiated with the database.
      SPICE kernels are used to compute the local solar time of the
      measurements from the spacecraft or instrument clock times.
 
      As engineering values are entered into the database, stored
      database procedures are called to convert raw engineering DN
      values into physical units. The raw DN values are converted
      using stored polynomials unique to each engineering parameter..
      The polynomials were derived through hardware calibrations, see
      the TEGA RDR SIS Appendix 7.3 for a table of the engineering
      conversions.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      The TEGA RDR data set is composed of a series of date stamped
      files that contain 1 day&apos;s worth (24 hours, 00:00:00 UTC to
      23:59:59 UTC) of data for 4 different data types. The following
      sections describe each data type.
 
      SCRDR
      -----
        SC data are composed of scanning calorimeter data. These data
        are composed of data collection time and oven and sheild
        temperature and duty cycle data.
 
      EGSRDR
      ------
        EGSRDR data are mass spectrometer data collected in sweep
        mode. These data are composed of timing, mass spectrometer
        emission, temperature and voltage parameters, as well as
        detector counts at each of the four detectors.
 
      EGHRDR
      ------
        EGHRDR data are mass hopping mode EGA data. These data
        include start and stop times for the collection, voltage,
        emission energy and level, and counts at the detector.
 
      ENGRDR
      ------
        Engineering data are composed of the 84 different engineering
        readings monitored in TEGA. ENGRDR data is composed of
        collection time information and engineering value. The
        following is a list of all the engineering readings and a
        description of each.

      No TEGA specific software is provided with this data set.
 
      PDS-labeled images and tables can be viewed with the program
      NASAView, developed by the PDS and available for a variety of
      computer platforms from the PDS web site
      http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/software_download.cfm. There is no
      charge for NASAView.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The TEGA RDR will be delivered using DVD media. Formats will be
      based on standards for such products established by the
      Planetary Data System (PDS) [PDSSR2001].

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The data presented in the TEGA RDR is processed for engineering
      units and combined with converted timing. Accuracy of the data
      presented here is dependant on appropriate use of SPICE and
      pre-flight calibration data for engineering unit conversions.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      The TEGA RDR was reviewed internally by the TEGA team prior to
      release to the PDS. PDS will also performed an external peer
      review of the TEGA RDR.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      Data reported are derived from the minimally processed data
      received from the lander during nominal TEGA operations. All
      data received is reformatted into one of the EDR data types.
      RDR data is produced from the EDR data set, which by
      definition is of good quality.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    The RDR data set is limited by any errors in the EDR data set.
 
 
  Data Compression
  ===============
    No data compression is used.
