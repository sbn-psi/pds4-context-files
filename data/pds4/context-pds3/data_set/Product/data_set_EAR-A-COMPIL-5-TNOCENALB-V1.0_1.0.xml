  Data Set Overview
  =================
    OVERVIEW
 
    This data set is a compilation of published diameters, albedos, and
    densities for Transneptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs.  A total of 129
    objects are listed, many with more than one entry.  This version covers
    published values through 31 March 2013.
 
    DATA
 
    Data were collected from the published literature for TNOs and Centaurs,
    with many objects having data reported by more than one group.  Reported
    values for Pluto and Charon are limited to those published after 1985.
    Entries are listed by object permanent number, then by provisional
    designation, then by year of publication, then alphabetically by
    author(s).  Users are referred to the respective papers regarding details
    of observations and methodology.
 
 
    TABLES
 
    The table &apos;tno_centaur_diam_alb_dens&apos; lists data for objects with the
    following columns:
 
       * object number, name, and provisional designation;
       * object heliocentric semimajor axis (AU), eccentricity, and
      inclination;
       * object dynamical type;
       * number of known companions;
       * MPC-reported absolute magnitude (as of 31 March 2013);
       * absolute magnitude value used in albedo calculation with error bar;
       * effective diameter (km) with upper/lower error bars and note code;
       * primary diameter (km) with upper/lower error bars and note code;
       * companion diameter (km) with upper/lower error bars and note code;
       * albedo with upper/lower error bars, note code, and color code;
       * system mass density (g/cm^3) with upper/lower error bars and note
      code;
       * methods used for diameter/albedo determination and density
      determination;
       * and reference code.
 
    Dynamical type codes are as follows:
       1:2 = Neptune 1:2 resonance object,
       2:5 = Neptune 2:5 resonance object,
       2:7 = Neptune 2:7 resonance object,
       3:5 = Neptune 3:5 resonance object,
       3:8 = Neptune 3:8 resonance object,
       3:10 = Neptune 3:10 resonance object,
       4:7 = Neptune 4:7 resonance object,
       CEN = Centaur,
       CUB = Cubewano,
       HAU = Haumea family,
       NL4 = Neptune trojan, L4 position,
       PLU = Plutino (= Neptune 2:3 resonance object),
       SAT = satellite,
       SDO = scattered disk object, and
       TNO = other Transneptunian Object.
    Dynamical types are based on the Minor Planet Center &apos;Unusual Minor
    Planet&apos; listings and on classifications by the Deep Ecliptic Survey Team
    [http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/kbo/desclass.html] (see Elliot et al.,
    2005).  Haumea family members are those listed by Snodgrass et al., 2010.
 
    For single objects, effective diameter is the measured diameter and the
    component diameter columns have null values.  For objects with more than
    one component, effective diameter is the combined effective diameter
    (where D_eff^2 = D_1^2 + D_2^2 for binaries, etc.) and individual
    component diameters are provided in the respective columns.  In general,
    albedo and density values are the system averages; if they are specific to
    a component, they include a note code specifying which component (1, 2, 3,
    ...) in a separate entry for that component.  Separate entries are also
    provided for additional components after the first two, again with note
    codes specifying which component (3, 4, ...).
 
    Note codes indicate comments on data values as follows (more than one code
    may apply):
       1, 2, 3, ... = component diameter for first, second, third, etc.,
      system component;
       A = assumed, applies to adopted values used from other publications or
      to assumed densities used for dynamical determinations of
      diameter/albedo;
       D = derived by the compiler from values reported by the respective
      source;
       G = greater than;
       L = less than;
 
    Albedo color codes indicate color reported by the source:  B = blue, R =
       red, V = visual, and * = geometric (no color specified).
 
    Method codes for diameter/albedo determinations are as follows (more than
    one code may apply):
       A = assumed or adopted value;
       E = mutual events;
       I = direct imaging;
       M = multiple or modified methods (see respective source for details);
       O = stellar occultation;
       T = thermal/radiometric observations/modeling;
       Y = dynamical (based on system mass from orbit determination, observed
      magnitude, and assumed density;
       * = reanalysis of previously published results.
 
    Method codes for density determinations are as follows (more than one code
    may apply):
       H = hydrodynamic model (based on observed/derived oblateness).
       M = multiple or modified methods (see respective source for details);
       Y = dynamical (based on system mass from orbit determination and
      independently measured diameter);
       * = reanalysis of previously published results.
 
    Reference codes refer to full reference information listed in the
    &apos;references&apos; table.  This table has columns for reference code and full
    reference.
 
    Regarding uncertainties on measured values, readers are referred to the
    respective references.  Dashes or invalid inputs (usually -9.99) indicate
    unassigned or unknown values.
