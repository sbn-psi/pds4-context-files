            measurements from the Galileo plasma wave receiver obtained
            during the second Earth encounter. These measurements are
            electric or magnetic waveforms obtained by rapidly sampling the
            potential at the input to the receiver from either the electric
            dipole antenna or the magnetic search coil antenna. The sample

    This data set includes wideband waveform measurements from the Galileo
    plasma wave receiver obtained during the second Earth encounter.  These
    measurements are electric or magnetic waveforms obtained by rapidly
    sampling the potential at the input to the receiver from either the
    electric dipole antenna or the magnetic search coil antenna.  The sample
    rates are 201,600 s^-1, 25,200 s^-1, or 3,150 s^-1 taken through bandpass
    filters of 80, 10, or 1 kHz, respectively.  Each sample is a 4-bit
    measurement after an automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier designed to
    keep the signal amplitude in a range commensurate with the optimal
    analog-to-digital converter dynamic range with a time constant of about
    500 msec.  As such, the measurements are not absolutely calibrated,
    although it is possible to determine the approximate AGC gain from a
    digital performance parameter available every 2.667 seconds, assuming the
    signal amplitude does not vary appreciably over the 2.667 second interval.
    Alternately, the sweep frequency receiver (low rate) portion of the
    instrument can be used to determine the absolute amplitude of waves.  In
    many cases, the waveform data are used without any calibration for the
    purposes of identifying characteristic frequencies of the plasma via
    resonances or cutoffs, observing discrete emissions such as chorus or
    whistlers, or looking at the detailed form of the waveforms.
 
    In general, the waveform samples are not continuous over long time
    periods due to the limited telemetry capability of the Galileo data
    system and limits on the bandwidth available to the PWS instrument.
    Instead, sequences of contiguous samples are collected for up to about
    67 msec followed by a gap.  The number of consecutive samples between
    gaps is determined by the telemetry format and the bandwidth (instrument
    mode).  Details of the timing, number of consecutive samples in a series,
    and the effective duty cycle are described in the inst.cat, rowpfx.fmt,
    and edrhdr.fmt files included with the data set.
 
    The data are formatted in files covering no more than 1 RIM (60.667 s)
    each up to 91 data records, with a record containing 10 or 80 blocks of
    contiguous waveform samples.  The data in any one file are from only a
    single combination of instrument mode (waveform) and telemetry format,
    however, the antenna can change within a file; this is noted in the
    record header information, but is only updated every 2.667 sec, hence,
    may not be accurate less than 2.667 seconds after a real antenna change.
    Since the instrument mode information is also updated only once per 2.667
    seconds, the last data in a record (less than 2.667 seconds) may actually
    be in a different mode.
 
    The typical uses of the waveform data are to (1) display the waveform
    of plasma wave and other signals such as dust impacts, and (2) as
    highly detailed (in time and frequency) spectra through the use of
    Fourier transforms.  To avoid artifacts, we suggest not transforming
    over the gaps but limiting the input to the Fourier transform to a
    single contiguous series of samples.  Spectra from individual waverform
    series can be stacked in order to generate frequency-time dynamic
    spectrograms.
 
    During the time interval spanned by this data set, Galileo approached
    Earth from the local early morning sector, made a close approach to
    Earth by passing through the magnetosphere, plasmasphere, ionosphere,
    and finally exited the Earth system in the local late morning.

    This data set includes all available wideband waveform data within the
    interval of time covered.  Original EDRs contained inaccuracies in the
    instrument status and Spacecraft Event Time (SCET).  Each file contains
    a corrected SCET in the attached PDS label and binary EDR header, and
    corrected instrument status information in the record headers.  The mag-
    netic spectra contain narrowband interference lines at 2.4 kHz and har-
    monics.  Operation of the UVS grating stepper motor produces a series of
    narrowband interference lines in the magnetic spectra between about 100 Hz
    and 2 kHz.  Missing data are indicated by zero.
