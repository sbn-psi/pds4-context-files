      Data Set Overview
      =================
      The data presented with this data set include:
 
      1) SIGHTING.TAB - contains a listing of 8210 individual sightings
                        associated with 2004 asteroids. SIGHTING.TAB
                        contains the observation index, the
                        identification of asteroids sighted, information
                        pertaining to observation times, positional
                        information on the observations of asteroids
                        detected, geometric albedos, diameters and their
                        associated uncertainties, input values used in
                        the calculations of the geometric albedos and
                        diameters using the asteroid standard thermal
                        model, the observed flux densities in each band,
                        detector crossing information, correlation
                        coefficients, and status flags for reduction
                        steps.
 
      2) DIAMALB.TAB -  contains averaged radiometric diameters and
                        geometric albedos derived from individual
                        observations for 1796 numbered asteroids and 88
                        unnumbered asteroids (as of 1983) whose orbital
                        elements were determined using astrometry from
                        two or more apparitions.
 
      3) SINGLE.TAB  -  contains an entry for each of 120 asteroids for
                        which there is an accepted sighting, but in one
                        band only.  This file includes the absolute
                        visual magnitude of the asteroid, the albedo and
                        diameter derived from the measurement and their
                        associated uncertainties, and the accepted
                        status word.
 
      4) GRNDDAT.TAB -  contains entries for each of 4677 numbered
                        asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of
                        1985) for which associations were sought in the
                        IRAS data.  Asteroids 719 Albert and 878 Mildred
                        were still lost as of 1985 and are not included.
                        These entries include an initial estimate of
                        geometric albedo and diameter used in processing
                        IRAS survey observations of asteroids, the
                        adopted taxonomic classification, and the
                        orbital elements at three epochs.  The Julian
                        dates of the epochs are 2445400.5, 2445500.5,
                        and 2445600.5. For further information regarding
                        these data see Tedesco, et. al., 1992
                        [TEDESCOETAL1992].
 
      5) IMPSSTAT.TAB - contains a summary of the number of times each
                        asteroid was predicted to be scanned, and
                        possible reasons for any failure to be detected.
                        It contains entries for each of 4677 numbered
                        asteroids and 2632 unnumbered asteroids (as of
                        1985) for which associations were sought in the
                        IRAS data.  Asteroids 719 Albert and 878 Mildred
                        were still lost as of 1985 and are not included.
                        These entries include the number of predicted
                        sightings, number of accepted sightings, number
                        of rejected sightings, number of missed
                        predicted sightings, number of missed predicted
                        faint sightings, number of dead 25 micron
                        detector non-detections, number of noisy 25
                        micron detector non-detections, number of missed
                        predictions in the galactic center region, and
                        other non-detections.
 
      6) REJECT.TAB  -  summarizes the number of rejected sightings for
                        each asteroid and possible reasons for
                        rejection.
 
      7) MISSED.TAB  -  contains a summary of those asteroids which were
                        predicted to pass across the IRAS focal plane
                        during survey mode, but which generated no
                        accepted associations.  Entries include the
                        number of times an asteroid was predicted to be
                        scanned but was missed, and the derived greatest
                        lower limit on the albedo and least upper limit
                        on the diameter, plus a status word detailing
                        the circumstances of the observation failure.
 
      8) STMODEL.TAB -  contains the flux look-up table used to generate
                        the IMPS albedos.  This table was provided by L.
                        Lebofsky and was derived from the IRAS standard
                        thermal model.
 
 
      In the original release of the IMPS data products, a number of
      &apos;derived status word (ADSTAT)&apos; bits were always set to zero (flag
      not set), and have been excluded here, these were:
 
      ADSTAT 1 - All bands. Not used. Always zero.
 
      ADSTAT 2 - All bands. Not used. Always zero.
 
      ADSTAT 3 - All bands. Not used. Always zero.
 
      ADSTAT 5 - All bands. Not used. Always zero.
 
      ADSTAT 6 - All bands. Not used. Always zero.
 
      ADSTAT 7 - 100 micron band. No albedos derived from individual
        observations in this band were rejected from the final average
        using Chauvenet&apos;s criterion, therefore this flag was always set
        to zero for this band in this datafile.
 
      ADSTAT 8 - 25 micron band. The albedo calculation for each
        observation converged within 100 iterations, therefore this flag
        was always set to zero for this band in this datafile.
 
      In the original released IMPS data product, the bits in the ADSTAT
      word were ordered from right to left.
 
 
      A number of &apos;confusion status word (ASTCST)&apos; bits were also always
      set to zero (flag not set), and have been excluded here, these
      were:
 
      ASTCST 5 - Set after hours-confirmation. Since sightings
        detections are only seconds-confirmed, this flag is always set
        to zero.
 
      ASTCST 6 - Set after hours-confirmation. Since sightings
        detections are only seconds-confirmed, this flag is always set
        to zero.
 
      ASTCST 7 - Set to 1 when an analog to digital saturation flag was
        set due to a bright source saturating at least one detector in
        this band. No such events in IMPS in any band.
 
      ASTCST 8 - Not used. Always zero.
 
 
      In addition, a number of &apos;asteroid status word (ASTATW)&apos; bits
      were always set to zero (flag not set) or one (flag set) and
      have been excluded here, these were:
 
      ASTATW 5  - WSDB MCON position match.  All MCON (WSDB &apos;weeks&apos; or
        months confirmed) asteroid sightings are rejected by IMPS.
        These sightings are likely to be confused with stationary
        background sources (e.g. molecular clouds, galaxies, knots of
        infrared cirrus). See ASTATW 9. No accepted detections had flag
        set.
 
      ASTATW 8  - IMPS asteroid association.  Set to unity for every
        accepted asteroid sighting, therefore the flag is always one
        in this file by definition.
 
      ASTATW 9  - Point Source Ver. 2 match.  All asteroid sightings
        confused with sources in the IRAS Point Source Catalog are
        rejected by IMPS. This is a subset of ASTATW 5.
 
      ASTATW 10 - Detections only by small detectors on the outer edge
        of the focal plane array.  No accepted detections had this flag
        set.
 
      ASTATW 11 - Predicted flux &lt; 0.14 Jy.  Set a priori for all
        candidate associations of an IMPS asteroid if no predicted flux
        density at 25 microns is greater than 0.14 Jansky. No detections
        were accepted when this flag was set.
 
      ASTATW 16 - 100 micron albedo used in the final average albedo.
        Since no 100 micron detections contribute to derived IMPS
        average values, this flag is never set.
 
      ASTATW 17 - Faint Source Version 2 match.  All asteroid sightings
        confused with sources in the IRAS Faint Source Survey are
        rejected by IMPS (See MOSHIRETAL1992), therefore this flag is
        always zero in this data file.
 
      ASTATW 20 - Serendipitous Version 1 match.  All asteroid sightings
        confused with sources in the IRAS Serendipitous Survey Catalog
        are rejected by IMPS (See KLEINMANETAL1986), therefore this flag
        is always set to zero in this data file.
 
      ASTATW 29 - Not used. Always zero.
 
      ASTATW 31 - 2+ sightings match.  Set if more than one source is
        associated with a single asteroid prediction and therefore
        rejected by IMPS.  No detections were accepted in this file
        when this flag was set.
 
      ASTATW 32 - Not used. Always zero.
 
 
      Modification History
      ====================
      The IMPS data set was ingested in 1994 and updated to correct a
      minor error in 1995.  These versions included only FP102, the
      diameters and albedos.  The data set has now been updated to
      include FP103, FP104, FP105, FP 106, FP107, FP108, and the flux
      lookup table used tto generate the IMPS albedos.
 
      As part of a general review of archive data in Feb 2002, the
      labels and data files were examined and the following changes
      made:
 
        o Numbers were provided for all asteroids numbered
          as of 15 Jan 2002. Numbers were found by referencing Ted
          Bowell&apos;s cross-identification database, as incorporated
          into the Small Bodies Data Base of the PDS Small Bodies
          Node (SBN). Provisional identifications from the original
          IMPS files were retained for cross-referencing.
 
        o Names were provided for all asteroids named as of 02 Feb
          2002. Names were gathered from the list provided by the
          Minor Planet Center at this URL:
 
             http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPNames.html
 
        o All files listing asteroid observations except &apos;sighting.tab&apos;
          were re-sorted on asteroid number. Asteroids identified only
          by provisional designation are located at the bottom of the
          files, sorted by provisional ID. The &apos;sighting.tab&apos; file was
          and is sorted on sightings index number.
 
        o Minor errors were corrected as found (e.g., the wrong value
          for &apos;COLUMNS&apos; was found in two labels; incorrect &apos;START_BYTE&apos;
          values were found in another).
 
        o Potentially confusing references to &apos;FPA.LBL&apos;, a file from a
          different data set, were replaced by a reference to the
          appropriate PDS DATA_SET_ID.
 
        o Cosmetic changes were made to bring labels and catalog files
          into conformance with current PDS/SBN standards and practices.
 
        o Documentation found in some of the labels regarding status
          words which were systematically excluded from more than one
          of the data files was extracted from those labels and
          incorporated into the information above.
