    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The dataset contains measurements from the infrared
      interferometer spectrometer and ancillary data.  Each record of
      the dataset consists of a header and a spectral observation of
      Mars; the header contains pointing and other information on the
      geometry of the observation.  The dataset is ordered by time as
      measured by the Data Acquisition System (DAS) time (1 DAS count
      is approximately 1.2 sec.).  Two IRIS frames are completed every
      35 DAS counts; every eighth IRIS frame is devoted to a
      calibration observation (alternately of interstellar space and
      an internal calibration blackbody), and is therefore absent from
      the calibrated dataset.
 
      The spectral data consist of calibrated thermal emission spectra
      expressed as spectral radiances in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1.  The
      wavenumber corresponding to each spectral radiance value is not
      included in the dataset; the beginning wavenumber and the
      constant wavenumber increment are given, permitting easy
      calculation of the appropriate wavenumber for each radiance.
      The calibrated radiances have been obtained from the directly
      measured interferograms of Mars, along with the deep space and
      internal blackbody calibration observations.  The interferograms
      are first symmetrized to correct for the fact that they are not
      sampled at zero path difference, and to remove the asymmetry
      due to residual dispersion in the beamsplitter and compensator.
      The symmetrized interferograms are then apodized using a Hamming
      function, and are cosine transformed.  The responsivity obtained
      from the deep space and internal blackbody measurements is then
      used to obtain calibrated radiances.
 
      Mariner 9 was placed in a 12 hour orbit about Mars at Lsubs=293,
      with data transmitted in real time during a 2 hour period around
      periapsis.  The 12 hour period was selected to assure that the
      spacecraft was always visible from the single large receiving
      antenna at Goldstone, California once per day (the even numbered
      orbits).  Data from alternate (odd numbered) orbits was received
      by a smaller antenna at Madrid, Spain; the lower signal-to-noise
      ratio in these data resulted in numerous &apos;spikes&apos; in the IRIS
      interferograms, and a correspondingly high rejection rate during
      processing.  Consequently, very few Martian spectra were
      obtained on odd numbered orbits.  In addition, after 107 days
      (Lsubs=353), the changing planetary alignments moved the earth
      off of the transmitting antenna pattern; thereafter, only data
      that had been recorded were obtained, since transmission
      required a spacecraft maneuver to target the earth.
      Consequently, only a handful of data were received from Lsubs=5
      to the end of mission at Lsubs=98.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      Interferograms with serious distortions or uncorrectable spikes
      have been rejected during processing.  These deletions, together
      with the calibration observations, result in gaps in the stream
      of Martian spectra.
 
      The IRIS instrument measures net infrared flux, either emitting
      radiation (when viewing a target colder than the instrument), or
      absorbing radiation (when viewing a target warmer than the
      instrument).  The sign (phase) of this flux is calculated as a
      function of wave number, and is applied during calibration to
      provide the proper amplitude of the spectral radiance.  Errors
      in this phase determination sometimes occur at wavenumbers where
      the brightness temperature of the scene is very close to the
      instrument temperature (~254 K).  This produces small
      discontinuous &apos;steps&apos; in the resulting radiances.  A few such
      errors remain in the dataset, usually in the brightness
      temperature range 252K - 256K.
 
      The noise equivalent spectral radiance (NESR) provides a measure
      of the random errors in the spectra, expressed in radiometric
      units.  It is defined as the radiance corresponding to a
      signal-to-noise ratio of unity, and represents the one-sigma
      uncertainty in an individual spectrum.  It is calculated from
      the standard deviation of measurements taken while the
      instrument is viewing deep space.  Above 250 cm**-1, the NESR is
      typically 5.E-8 Watts/cm**2/sr/cm**-1; actual values of the NESR
      are given for selected wavenumbers in the following Table 1
      (above 800 cm-1, the corresponding Noise Equivalent Brightness
      Temperature increases roughly linearly, from approximately 140K
      at 1000 cm-1, to 240K at 2000 cm-1).  A complete NESR spectrum
      is included in the auxiliary data of the
      MARINER9-MARS-IRIS-3-RDR-V1.0 dataset.  Six sharp spikes, with
      amplitudes typically 10-50% of the NESR, are present in the NESR
      spectrum.  Such spikes can represent the transforms of harmonic
      interference.  The wavenumber of each spike, along with the
      interference frequency required to produce the spike, is shown
      in Table 2.  The most probable sources of these spikes are
      transients caused by the engineering telemetry channels which
      have characteristic frequencies of 8-1/3 and 33-1/3 bps.  The
      source of the interference at 28.27 Hz is unknown.

      At wavenumbers where the radiance of the scene is near or below
      the instrument noise level, e.g., at high wavenumbers in polar
      spectra, the calibration procedure has resulted in nonnegative
      radiances.  Consequently, averaging of spectra over such
      intervals does not result in a statistical reduction of noise,
      but tends toward a small, nearly constant, positive value.  This
      is meaningless.
 
      The pointing information provided in the headers was derived by
      the Mariner 9 Project from knowledge of the spacecraft position
      (determined from trajectory analysis), the spacecraft
      orientation (determined from sun and star sensor data, and by
      displacements within the limit cycle), and the articulation of
      the scan platform on which the instruments were mounted.  Early
      in the mission, while the orbit was being adjusted frequently,
      such information was inadequate to derive the detailed pointing
      of the instruments, and so is missing.  Gaps in the pointing
      information can be found in the headers for orbits 1 and 2.  The
      orbit was stabilized with a periapsis near 1390 km by orbit 5
      (it varied by a few kilometers thereafter, due to irregularities
      in the Martian gravitational field).  At orbit 90(?), periapsis
      was raised to a value near 1650 km, where it remained until the
      end of the mission.  Thus, spacecraft altitudes significantly
      below these values are spurious; other related geometric
      variables may also be corrupted.
 
      Scattered throughout the dataset are 110 records for which the
      phase angle at the observation point (PHASE_ANGLE) is zero, and
      7 records for which the spacecraft altitude (SC_ALT), angle
      between the line of sight and the center of Mars
      (ANGLE_LOS_MARS), angle between the line of sight and the
      nearest limb point of Mars (ANGLE_LOS_LIMB), and the angular
      semidiameter of Mars (ANGLE_SEMI_DIAM) are also all zero; other
      geometric variables for the observation are present.  For all
      geometric computations, the radius of Mars is taken as 3387 km.
      The angular radius of the IRIS FOV is taken as 2.20 degrees.
 
      At various times during the mission, some of the parameters in
      the header were given meaningless values; these values have been
      replaced with estimated values, and a flag has been set to
      indicate that a change has been made.
