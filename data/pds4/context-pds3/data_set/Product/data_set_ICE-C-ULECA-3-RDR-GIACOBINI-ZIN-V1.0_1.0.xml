   Data Set Overview
   =================
   The energetic particle observations presented here were made with the
   University of Maryland/Max-Planck-Institut ULECA sensor on the
   International Cometary Explorer encounter with comet Giacobini-Zinner
   in Sept, 1985.  The ULECA sensor is well suited for these studies
   since its energy range (30-180 keV) is close to that of water group
   ions, whose initial energy  of 20 keV in the solar wind (SW) frame
   (for V (SW) = 450 km s** -1) corresponds to 0-80 keV in the
   spacecraft frame before acceleration to higher energies in the
   turbulence associated with the comet.  The instrument uses a
   multislit collimator, an electrostatic deflection system, and an
   array of silicon solid-state detectors to identify particle energy,
   and energy per charge, from which the charge state may be derived.  A
   general description of the ULECA sensor has been published by
   Hovestadt et al. (1978).
 
   The ULECA sensor view angle extends +/- 3O degree off the ecliptic
   plane; the spacecraft rotation scans the ecliptic, with the count
   rates divided into eight sectors, numbered 0-7, with sector 5
   centered on the solar direction.  In the NSSDC submission, data are
   used from different groups of sectors.  The nomenclature used is as
   follows: solar sector means data from sector 5 only; solar sectors
   means data from sectors 4, 5, and 6; and &apos;antisolar sectors&apos; means
   data from sectors 0, 1, and 2.
 
   The ULECA instrument response and the data analysis are sensitive
   to the mass of the incident ions, but they do not measure this mass
   directly.  In our earlier work (Ipavich et al., 1986) it was shown
   that the particles in our energy range had a mass of at least 12 amu.
   At plasma energies, (Ogilvie et al. 1986) showed that H,O + ions
   were dominant among the singly charged ions, which is consistent
   Halley data. For this case the three energy channels of ULECA for
   singly charged particles (Mll, M21, and M31) have mean energies of
   35, 70, and 150 keV,, respectively.  The energy resolution full
   widths at half maximum, delta E/E, are 20, 27, and 37%, respectively.
   The efficiencies for detec- tion of water group ions were determined
   by a detailed analysis which included evaluation of thresholds,
   energy defect, and noise width, for each detector.  The resulting
   efficiencies are 0.95, 2.6, and 3.4% for the M11, M21, and M31
   channels, respectively (Ipavich et al., 1986).
 
 
   Data
   ====
   At encounter the ICE spacecraft traversed the cometary region along a
   path almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, moving from south to
   north.  The relative speed of the spacecraft to the comet was -21 km
   s-1.  The submitted data is high time resolution (256 s) summary
   records (count rates) for the period centered on closest approach,
   1102 UT on September 11, 1985.
 
   The M21 count rate, however, was contaminated by cross talk with
   another detector in the instrument.  Although large, this cross talk
   was not dependent on the pointing direction of the spacecraft, making
   it possible to correct M21 by assum- ing that all counts in the
   antisolar sectors.were background and then subtracting this level
   from the measured counts in the solar sectors.  The M21 data archived
   were not corrected in this manner (see Tan et al 1990), and have a
   substantial background count.
 
   The counts rates for both sectored and non-sectored data have been
   included to capture all the relevant rate designations (Table 1 from
   Hovestadt et al. 1978).   Sectored data for format C (M 11, M13, M31,
   M22, M21) and format E (L1, L2, E1, M12) are for 8 recorded sectors.
   Non-sectored data for format E (E1, E2, E3, E4, M11, M12, M13, M31,
   M22, M23, M21, M32, M33, MB1, MB2, MB3, MP12, MP1L, MP2L, MP3L) are
   also included.

   Review
   ======
 
   PDS Peer review was held in fall 1998.
 
 
   Data Coverage and Quality
   =========================
 
   The original data was converted from binary files to ASCII tables
   at the NSSDC.  Data covered a time period from Sept 8-22 but only
   the relevant period (Tan et al. 1993) for Sept 9-13 is included.
