      Description
      -----------
        A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit
        volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,
        or energy/nucleon.  Discrimination with regard to mass and or
        charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,
        mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument
        limitations.
 
        Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are
        distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or
        their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of
        moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will
        be provided in a single dataset.  In general, if more than
        one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total
        density will be provided which is the sum of the ion
        densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian
        distribution the actual distribution can be represented as
        the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of
        each Maxwellian is given.

    Overview
    ========
      THIS DATA SET PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSITIVE ION CHARGE
      DENSITY.  SEVERAL ASSUMPTION ARE MADE TO SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS;
      THESE MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE RESULTS.  HIGH MACH NUMBER
      FLOW IS ASSUMED; MACH NUMBERS OF 2-3, WHICH ARE REASONABLE
      LOWER LIMITS FOR HEAVY IONS, RESULT IN 10-20% UNDERESTIMATES OF
      THE CHARGE DENSITY.  THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES A UNIT RESPONSE (IE.,
      ALL PARTICLES IN A COLD BEAM INCIDENT ON THE APERTURE OF THE
      EXPERIMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AT THE COLLECTOR).  THE ACTUAL
      RESPONSE IS DOCUMENTED IN MCNUTT ET AL.  (1981) AND CAN BE AS
      LOW AS 70%.  A VELOCITY INTO THE DETECTOR MUST ALSO BE ASSUMED;
      THE VELOCITY USED IS THE COROTATION VELOCITY INSIDE OF 17.5 RJ
      AND 200 KM/S OUTSIDE OF THIS.  THIS VELOCITY PROFILE IS IN
      ACCORD WITH THAT MEASURED WHERE VELOCITY DETERMINATIONS ARE
      POSSIBLE, BUT THE USE OF INCORRECT VALUES GIVE ERRORS IN THE
      DENSITY WHICH VARY LINEARLY WITH ERRORS IN THE VELOCITY.
      FINALLY, ONLY IONS IN THE PLS ENERGY RANGE (10-5950 EV/Q) ARE
      COUNTED.  THE CUMULATIVE ERROR FROM ALL THESE EFFECTS IS LESS
      THAN 10% IN THE SOLAR WIND, LESS THAN A FACTOR OF TWO IN THE
      OUTER MAGNETOSPHERE (R&gt;20 RJ) AND LESS THAN 20-30% INSIDE OF
      THIS.  SINCE THE AMPLITUDE OF EACH OF THESE EFFECTS VARIES
      SLOWLY IN TIME (DISTANCE), THE RELATIVE CHANGES IN DENSITY ARE
      GOOD TO A FEW PERCENT IN MOST CASES.
