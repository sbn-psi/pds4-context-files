Data Set Overview
=================
    LOLA is a pulse detection, time-of-flight laser altimeter. LOLA transmits
    a 5-spot pattern that measures the precise distance to the lunar surface
    at multiple points simultaneously, thus providing 5 profiles across the
    lunar surface.  Each spot within the five-spot pattern has a diameter of
    approximately five meters and are ~25 meters apart in the nominal
    50-km-high mapping orbit.  They take the form of a cross canted by 26
    degree counterclockwise, repeating every ~57 meters along-track. These
    spots provide up to five adjacent profiles whose separation depends
    spacecraft altitude.
 
    The RDR data set is a time-ordered collection of measurement data from
    LOLA, calibrated, geolocated, and aggregated by orbit.  Each topographic
    return is located with respect to the lunar center of mass in a body-
    fixed (rotating) coordinate frame.
 
    The LOLA RDR data product consists of two files. One contains the data
    itself, and is arranged in a PDS compliant binary table. The other is
    a PDS label file which describes the content of the table:
    the start and end times of the observation, product creation
    time, mission phase, software algorithms, and parameter files used to
    generate the data.  The label file also contains pointers to description
    of the different fields within the table.
 
Processing
==========
    A full description of the LOLA data processing can be found in the RDR SIS
    located in the document folder that accompanies this archive.  The
    following paragraphs are a summary of how the data are processed from data
    receipt through averaging.
 
    The LOLA instrument data packets consist of time-ordered, round-trip,
    time-of-flight ranges to the lunar surface, preceded by housekeeping and
    ancillary data.  LOLA outputs these 3424-byte packets over the spacecraft
    IEEE-1553 data bus at 1-s intervals.  The LRO Solid State Recorder
    aggregate packets into files at commanded intervals.  Each file, stripped
    of telemetry headers, becomes an Experiment Data Record product (EDR).
 
    The LRO Ground Data System receives science data from each downlink
    tracking pass and transmits them promptly to the LOLA Science Operation
    Center (SOC) computer.  Processing calibrates EDRs spanning a single
    mission orbit to time-of-flight ranges and other measurements using an
    automated pipeline.  The geolocation processing cycle merges the data
    records with spacecraft housekeeping and tracking data solutions,
    transforming them to geolocated altimetric returns together with
    ancillary data. Each orbit begin nominally at the spacecraft
    ascending node as determined from ephemeris predictions, in one-to-one
    correspondence with the EDRs, following the LRO Project orbital
    numbering convention.  The position of each laser spot, located on the
    surface using a spacecraft trajectory, attitude history, and a precise
    lunar orientation model, is output as a reduced data record (RDR)
    product.  Each laser shot generates one record with up to five valid
    lunar ranges.  Ancillary measurements of energies and reflectivities as
    well as quality flags are included in each record.
 
    The LRO Ultrastable Oscillator, which is monitored by ground stations,
    provides timing of LOLA instrument events. LRO employs Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC) to correlate spacecraft Mission Elapsed Time (MET)
    to ground time with an accuracy of +/- 3 ms. The correlation of MET
    time to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) is maintained at much higher
    precision by the Laser Ranging system and orbital theories. The LOLA
    data analysis use TDB as its primary time system (see http://tycho.usno.
    navy.mil/systime.html for details). Processing projects the spacecraft
    states relative to the Solar System Barycenter (SSB) at the laser
    transmit and detector receive times along the instrument boresight and
    return path vectors to match the observed time-of-flight times the
    speed of light, correcting for the aberration of light and general-
    relativistic time delays. SSB states are determined in the Earth Mean
    Equator of 2000 (J2000) inertial reference frame using lunar spacecraft
    trajectories and the DE421 planetary ephemeris [WILLIAMSETAL2008,
    FOLKNERETAL2008].
 
    The barycentric coordinates of the laser bounce point
    are transformed from J2000 to a geodetic coordinate frame about the
    center of mass of the Moon, using the DE421 Moon Mean-Earth and Rotation
    Pole (MOON_ME) orientation model.  The DE421 model incorporates 37
    years of Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data, thereby providing the current
    geodetic framework for LOLA.  The lunar radius and position are then
    subjected to orbital crossover analysis to minimize the terrain
    mismatch at the intersections of ground tracks.  Empirical adjustment
    of short-term pointing biases is combined with orbital estimation from
    tracking data to bring the ground tracks into agreement, and produce a
    dynamically-consistent lunar geodetic coordinate framework.  The
    crossover adjustment is performed monthly intervals following the
    propulsive orbital adjustment maneuvers that break the dynamical orbit
    solutions.  A byproduct of the tracking and crossover analysis is an
    improved lunar potential solution.
 
    Higher-level gridded and transformed data products are produced from the
    cumulative RDR data set.  Binning and interpolation of data values to
    regularly-spaced intervals are described in the LOLA RDR and higher level
    data product SIS document, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Lunar Orbiter
    Laser Altimeter Reduced Data Record and Derived Products Software
    Interface Specification, located in the DOCUMENT directory of this
    archive.  The values of surface slope and roughness are calculated over
    multiple baselines, but there are practically no planetary datasets of
    comparable resolution to use as benchmarks for useful derived products.
    Thus, their format and content may evolve with time.  Similarly, the
    bidirectional reflectance is likely to be a function of surface
    temperature and composition and may not be easily amenable to
    averaging.

Overview
========
    Revisions are made to the RDR data set after each orbital adjustmen
    maneuver.  The quality improves with each adjustment by minimizing
    discrepancies in measurement geometry knowledge between individual
    orbital tracks and the accumulating global average.
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
    LOLA operates virtually continuously except when commanded to
    stand by for spacecraft safety or instrument safety. During
    such intervals the laser will not fire but data packets will be
    generated and Earth ranges may be received. Parameter change
    to the flight software or operating mode are executed by direct memory
    writes, during which time the LOLA clock count will not update.
    This counter is adjusted in subsequent processing. A standby command is
    also issued to prevent laser firing while laser retroreflectors are in the
    instrument field of view, to prevent damage to the detectors.
 
    The altimetric coverage is a direct function of the duration and geometry
    of the near-polar LRO orbits. The concept of operation is to remain within
    two degrees of nadir. Targeting maneuvers are allocated for a small
    percentage of mission time during which the error budget for altimetry and
    geolocation may increase significantly. The coverage is also
    function of the probability of detection of each individual laser spot.
    During a given month approximately 348 full orbits are performed,
    providing approximately one ascending and descending track for every
    degree of longitude. Monthly station-keeping maneuvers adjust the
    orbital period slightly so as to maintain a 35-65 km altitude and avoid
    exact repeats of the ground track.
 
    The probability of detection of each spot was anticipated to be &gt; 95%
    at altitudes between 20 and 80 km, but during commissioning, spacecraft
    altitude reached more than 200 km at apoapse. Sensitivity of the altimeter
    is inversely proportional to the square of the altitude. Nevertheless some
    ranges were acquired at more than 120 km while at times no range
    were acquired around the 30-km periapse. Investigation of this anomalous
    behavior concluded that the most likely cause is thermal distortion of
    the alignment of the laser beam expander telescope due to the thermal
    contraction of the multi-layer insulation encasing the instrument. These
    blankets were mechanically attached to the telescope in such a way that
    cold temperatures they were no longer able to flex to accomodate thermal
    contraction and they pulled the laser spots out of alignment with the
    detector field of view. The misalignment was confirmed during an Earth-
    pointing raster scan, whereby the laser spots were imaged at a ground
    station while the detectors registered pulses fired from a ground laser.
 
    The LOLA On-orbit Signal Anomaly Final Report (LRO-LOLA-RPT-00200)
    describes the loss of signal. At this time there is no plan to correct it.
    Under the cold conditions of the lunar night side the distortion
    places sufficient laser energy in two of the detector fields of view to
    perform ranging, while secondary spots from the laser will occasionally
    illuminate the other detectors with enough energy to make a measurement.
    Transitions in alignment occur almost  immediately upon
    approaching the terminator between daylight and night.  During
    the first two days of ranging, LOLA was almost perpetually in
    twilight owing to the orbit plane geometry, and very few return
    were obtained, while over the sunlit face of the Moon the altimeter w
    able to range at distances of nearly 200 km. On average, about 60% of the
    possible returns were obtained during commissioning and early mapping.
    Performance is degraded over the poles where the most redundant coverage
    is obtained, while sufficient data are obtained at mid-latitudes to
    refine the cross-track coverage during day and night. As of this release
    LOLA has already met its minimum requirements for mission success in term
    of coverage density at the poles and is on track to meet its requirement
    for 1.25-km equatorial track spacing by the end of the nominal mission.
    Each of the two redundant lasers is operated alternately for one month
    time to provide ongoing health and engineering trend data.
    The lasers continue to output full design energy per shot and it is
    expected that they will complete the mapping mission phase with margin.
 
    Under nominal conditions, range data are believed to be accurate to 1
    meter overall, with better than 10 cm precision (1 sigma) shot-to-shot.
    There is a dependance on surface slope and roughness.  Additionally, at
    altitude greater than 50 km, return signals are weaker and accuracy will
    degrade somewhat. The Signal Anomaly also results in weaker pulses and
    somewhat erratic ranges. Direct assessment of range precision is
    impossible since there are no known extended targets on the Moon.
    Performance of the Laser Ranging signal being measured by identical
    hardware paths has shown shot-to-shot precision of better than 20 cm (1
    sigma) in one direction, which is equivalent to a two-way measurement
    precision of 10 cm.  Systematic effects such as clock drift, system
    response and range walk under varying signal strength were well under 1
    meter overall in pre-flight testing. Systematic difference between the
    five individual detectors are calibrated in the higher level products.
 
Limitation
===========
    Performance and calibration constants of the five detectors differ. In
    particular, detector 1 also receives Earth ranges and solar background
    through the Laser Ranging telescope.  Systematic differences between the
    five separate detector channels are calibrated as described in
    RIRISETAL2010.
 
    Alignment of the transmitted laser beam is taken from the post-shipment
    survey, and does not take into account the Signal Anomaly thermal effects.
    The Signal Anomaly also strongly affects the energy return measurement,
    one of the requirements for measuring the bidirectional reflectivity of
    the surface in the permanently shadowed regions of the Moon. Efforts have
    been made  to better characterize the instrument&apos;s thermal environment,
    alignment, and receiver response.
