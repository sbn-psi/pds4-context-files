    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This data set contains Raw data taken by New Horizons
        Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera
      instrument during the LAUNCH mission phase.
 
      The Post-Launch mission phase was used mainly for checkout,
      commissioning and calibration of the Ralph instruments (LEISA &amp;
      MVIC).  For details, refer to the following Ralph activity
      summary table:

      Every observation provided in this data set was taken as a part of a
      particular sequence.  A list of these sequences follows:

      For the list of observations and their parameters, refer to
      the data set index table (typically INDEX.TAB &amp; CUMINDEX.TAB,
      initially in the /INDEX/ area of the data set).
 
 
    Time
    ====
 
      There are several time systems, or units, in use in this dataset:
      New Horizons spacecraft MET (Mission Event Time or Mission Elapsed
      Time), UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), and TDB Barycentric
      Dynamical Time.
 
      This section will give a summary description of the relationship
      between these time systems.  For a complete explanation of these
      time systems the reader is referred to the documentation
      distributed with the NAIF/SPICE toolkit from the NAIF PDS node.
 
      The most common time unit associated with the data is is the
      spacecraft MET.  MET is a 32-bit counter on the New Horizons
      spacecraft that runs at a rate of about one increment per second
      starting from a value of zero at
 
        19.January, 2006 18:08:02 UTC
 
      or
 
        JD2453755.256337 TDB.
 
      The leapsecond adjustment (DELTA_ET = ET - UTC) over this dataset
      is 65.184s.
 
      The data labels for any given product in this dataset usually
      contain at least one pair of common UTC and MET representations
      of the time at the middle of the observation.  Other portions
      of the products, for example tables of data taken over periods
      of up to a day or more, will only have the MET time associated
      with a given row of the table.
 
      For the data user&apos;s use in interpreting these times, a reasonable
      approximation (+/- 1s) of the conversion between Julian Day (TDB)
      and MET is as follows:
 
        JD TDB = 2453755.256337 + ( MET / 86399.9998693 )
 
      For more accurate calculations the reader is referred to the
      NAIF/SPICE documentation as mentioned above.
 
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The data in this data set were created by a software data
      processing pipeline on the Science Operation Center (SOC) at
      the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI), Department of Space Studies.
      This SOC pipeline assembled data as FITS files from raw telemetry
      packets sent down by the spacecraft and populated the data labels
      with housekeeping and engineering values, and computed geometry
      parameters using SPICE kernels. The pipeline did not resample
      the data.
 
 
    Data
    ====
 
      The observations in this data set are stored in data files using
      standard Flexible Image Transport Sytem (FITS) format.  Each FITS
      file has a corresponding detached PDS label file, named according
      to a common convention.  The FITS files have image and/or table
      extensions; see the PDS label plus the DOCUMENT files for a
      description of these extensions and their contents.

        The observation sequences were defined in Science Activity

        Visit Number.  The SAPs are spreadsheets with one Visit Description
        &amp; Number per row.  A nominal target is also included on each row
        and included in the data labels, but does not always match with the
        TARGET_NAME field&apos;s value in the data labels.  In some cases, the
        target was designated as RA,DEC pointing values in the form
        ``RADEC=123.45,-12.34&apos;&apos; indicating Right Ascension and Declination,
        in degrees, of the target from the spacecraft in the Earth
        Equatorial J2000 inertial reference frame.  This indicates either
        that the target was either a star, or that the target&apos;s ephemeris
        was not loaded into the spacecraft&apos;s attitude and control system
        which in turn meant the spacecraft could not be pointed at the
        target by a body identifier and an inertial pointing value had to
        be specified as Right Ascension and Declination values.  The PDS
        standards do not allow putting a value like RADEC=... in the PDS
        TARGET_NAME keyword&apos;s value; in those cases the PDS TARGET_NAME
        value is set to CALIBRATION.
 
 
      Unresolved Liens on the Data
      ----------------------------
 
        None exist at the present time.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      The geometry items included in the data labels were computed
      using the SPICE kernels archived in the New Horizons SPICE
      data set, NH-X-SPICE-6-LAUNCH-V1.0.
 
 
    Reference Frame
    ===============
 
 
      Geometric Parameter Reference Frame
      -----------------------------------
        Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EMEJ2000) is the
        inertial reference frame used to specify observational geometry
        items provided in the data labels.  Geometric parameters are based
        on best available SPICE data at time of data creation.
 
 
      Epoch of Geometric Parameters
      -----------------------------
        All geometric parameters provided in the data labels were
        computed at the epoch midway between the START_TIME and
        STOP_TIME label fields.
 
 
 
    Software
    ========
 
      The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format
      with PDS labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided
      and commercial programs. For this reason no special software is
      provided with this data set.

      as described in PERSONNEL.CAT.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      During the processing of the data in preparation for
      delivery with this volume, the packet data associated with each
      observation were used only if they passed a rigorous verification
      process including standard checksums.
 
      In addition, raw (Level 2) observation data for which adequate
      contemporary housekeeping and other ancillary data are not available
      are not reduced to calibrated (Level 3) data.  This issue is raised
      here to explain why some data products in the raw data set,
 
        NH-X-MVIC-2-LAUNCH-V2.0,
 
      do not have corresponding data products in the calibrated data set,
 
        NH-X-MVIC-3-LAUNCH-V2.0.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      The data have been reviewed and validated by the instrument team
      members, as well as by SOC personnel.
 
 
    MVIC updates for Data Sets V2.0
    ===============================
 
 
      Improvements to motion distortion
      ---------------------------------
 
        For MVIC TDI images, the motion distortion correction now corrects
        for optical distortion, cross-track drift, along-track drift,
        spacecraft rotation and sets the scan to a common tangential plane
        centered at the image center.
 
        All interpolation is done using the IDL bilinear interpolation
        program.
