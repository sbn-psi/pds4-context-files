            This dataset contains CRISM Multispectral Reduced Data Records
            (MRDRs). MRDRs are organized into 30 subdirectories named by the
            Mars Chart containing the MRDR, e.g. MC01. Latitude and longitude
            limits of Mars Charts are given below. An MRDR consists of
            several or more strips of multispectral survey data mosaicked
            into a map tile. Thus a map tile is constructed from a large
            number of TRDRs. The mosaic is uncontrolled (accepting existing
            pointing data often resulting in image mismatch at seams within a
            mosaic). The tile contains up to four images: radiance extracted
            from temporary TRDRs Lambert albedo summary products DDR data
            used to generate the first three images, augmented with
            additional positional information The MRDR also contains up to
            two text files, one listing the wavelengths present and ther
            other listing the SPICE metakernels used for map projection of
            each constituent observation on the tile. Each file has a
            separate label. For every latitude or longitude in an MRDR, there
            is a radiance and all the information providing traceability to
            through I/F to Lambert albedo corrected for atmospheric,
            photometric, and thermal emission effects, plus the information
            needed to reconstruct the map projection. A global pattern of
            1964 such tiles is being used, forming the major data product for
            multispectral survey observations. Multiple MRDRs are in each of
            the 30 subdirectories.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This volume contains portions of the CRISM Multispectral Reduced
      Data Record (TRDR) Archive, a collection of multiband images
      from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars on
      the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.  Images consist of
      map-projected data calibrated to units of radiance plus a text
      files listing the wavelengths present and the SPICE metakernels
      used to project the constituent observations. Additional image
      data have had further corrections applied. Each image or text
      file is stored with a PDS label.
 
      This volume also contains an index file (&apos;imgindx.tab&apos;) that
      tabulates the contents of the volume, ancillary data files, and
      documentation files. It may also contain browse images in PNG
      format, and HTML documents that support a web browser interface
      to the volume.
 
      For more information on the contents and organization of the
      volume set refer to the aareadme.txt file located in the root
      directory of the data volumes.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
      CRISM observing scenarios are constructed using a set of key
      variables (&apos;configurations&apos;) which include the following (All
      are selectable separately for the VNIR and IR detectors. Only a
      subset of the configurations are used to generate MRDRs.
 
      Image source: Image data may be generated using digitized output
      from the detector, or using one of up to seven test patterns. Only
      data from the detector are processed to a TRDR.
 
      Pixel binning: Pixels can be saved unbinned or binned 2x, 5x, or
      10x in the spatial direction. No pixel binning in the spectral
      direction is supported. Data with 10x pixel binning are used in
      the generation of MRDRs.
 
      Row selection:  All detector rows having useful signal can be
      saved, or alternatively an arbitrary, commandable subset of rows
      can be saved. The number of rows with useful signal is 545, 107
      in the VNIR and 438 in the IR. The nominal number of rows for
      multispectral mode was 73, 18 in the VNIR and 55 in the IR prior
      to 10 Dec 2006. On that date an extra channel was added to the
      VNIR for a total of 19. For each detector, there are four
      options of channel selection to choose from rapidly by command:
      hyperspectral (545 total channels), multispectral (73 total
      channels prior to 10 Dec 2006, 74 total channels on and after 10
      Dec 2006), and two sets of expanded multispectral (84 and 92
      channels prior to 10 Dec 2006, 85 and 93 channels on and after
      10 Dec 2006). An analogy is a car radio preset button. New
      options are set by uploading a data structure to the DPU. Data
      with any wavelength selection may have a corresponding TRDR, but
      the wavelength selection affects the wavelength continuity and
      dimensionality of a TRDR.
 
      Calibration lamps: 4095 levels are commandable in each of two
      lamps at each focal plane, and in two lamps in the integrating
      sphere. All lamps can be commanded open-loop, meaning that current
      is commanded directly.  For the integrating sphere only, closed
      loop control is available at 4095 settings. For closed loop
      control, the setting refers to output from a photodiode viewing
      the interior of the integrating sphere; current is adjusted
      dynamically to attain the commanded photodiode output. Note: lamps
      reach maximum current at open- or closed-loop settings &lt;4095. Only
      data for which the calibration lamps are off may be processed to
      an MRDR.
 
      Shutter position:  Open, closed, or viewing the integrating
      sphere. The shutter is actually commandable directly to position 0
      through 32.  In software, open=3, sphere=17, closed=32. NOTE:
      during integration and testing, it was discovered that at
      positions &lt;3 the hinge end of the shutter is directly illuminated
      and creates scattered light. Position 3 does not cause this
      effect, but the other end of the shutter slightly vignettes
      incoming light. Only data in which the shutter is open, and at
      position 3, may be processed to an MRDR.
 
      Pointing:  CRISM has two basic gimbal pointing configurations and
      two basic superimposed scan patterns.  Pointing can be (1) fixed
      (nadir-pointed in the primary science orbit) or (2) dynamic,
      tracking a target point on the surface of Mars and taking out
      ground track motion.  Two types of superimposed scans are
      supported: (1) a short, 4-second duration fixed-rate (&apos;EPF-type&apos;)
      scan which superimposes a constant angular velocity scan on either
      of the basic pointing profiles, or (2) a long, minutes-duration
      fixed-rate (&apos;target swath-type&apos;) scan. Only fixed nadir-pointed
      data are processed to an MRDR.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The CRISM data stream downlinked by the spacecraft unpacks into a
      succession of compressed image frames with binary headers
      containing housekeeping. In each image, one direction is spatial
      and one is spectral.  There is one image for the VNIR focal plane
      and one image for the IR focal plane. The image from each focal
      plane has a header with 220 housekeeping items that contain full
      status of the instrument hardware, including data configuration,
      lamp and shutter status, gimbal position, a time stamp, and the
      target ID and macro within which the frame of data was taken.
      These parameters are stored as part of an Experiment Data Record
      (EDR), which consists of raw data. The data in one EDR
      represents a series of image frames acquired with a consistent
      instrument configuration (shutter position, frame rate, pixel
      binning, compression, exposure time, on/off status and setting
      of different lamps).
 
      Once data are assembled into EDRs, they are calibrated into TRDRs.
      Image data are converted to units of radiance using level-4 and
      level-6 CDRs, and analog housekeeping items in the text file
      (voltages, currents, and temperatures) have been converted into
      physical units using a level-6 CDR. Both files share a common
      label. The calibration algorithms are discussed at length in an
      Appendix in the CRISM Data Products SIS.
 
      A TRDR may also contain separately labeled multiband images in
      which radiance has been processed to one of the following:
 
        I/F (radiance divided by (pi * solar flux at 1 AU * heliocentric
        distance^2)),
 
        Lambert albedo, or
 
        a set of derived spectral parameters (summary products) that
        provide an overview of the data set. The summary products
        include Lambert albedo at key wavelengths, or key band depths
        or spectral reflectance ratios.
 
      To create Lambert albedo or most summary products, estimated
      corrections for atmospheric, photometric, and thermal effects are
      applied to the I/F data using corrections given in ADRs. The
      formulations for all of the summary products have been validated
      using data from Mars Express/OMEGA.
 
      Information on physical properties and illumination conditions of
      the site observed in the EDR or TRDR is maintained in a Derived
      Data Record or DDR. There are 14 layers in each DDR:
 
        Solar incidence angle relative to areoid, at the same planetary
        radius as surface projection of pixel, units degrees.
 
        Emission angle relative to areoid, at the same planetary
        radius as surface projection of pixel, units degrees.
 
        Solar phase angle, units degrees.
 
        Areocentric latitude, units degrees N.
 
        Areocentric longitude, units degrees E.
 
        Solar incidence angle relative to planetary surface as estimated
        using MOLA shape model, units degrees.
 
        Emission angle relative to planetary surface as estimated using
        MOLA shape model, units degrees.
 
        Slope magnitude, using MOLA shape model and reference ellipsoid,
        units degrees.
 
        Slope azimuth, using MOLA shape model and reference ellipsoid,
        units degrees clockwise from N.
 
        Elevation relative to MOLA datum, units meters.
 
        TES thermal inertia, units J m^-2 K^-1 s^-0.5.
 
        TES bolometric albedo, unitless.
 
        Spare.
 
        Spare.
 
      The sequence of processing that creates an MRDR from the above
      products is as follows:
 
      (a) EDRs are assembled from raw data.
 
      (b) The radiance multiband images in TRDRs are created from the
      EDRs and Calibration Data Records, or CDRs, using a calibration
      algorithm discussed at length in an Appendix in the CRISM Data
      Products SIS.
 
      (c) Gimbal positions are extracted from the EDR housekeeping and
      formatted as a gimbal C kernel.
 
      (d) Using the gimbal C kernel and other SPICE kernels, DDRs are
      created. The surface intercept on the MOLA shape model is
      calculated for each spatial pixel (sample at the reference
      detector row). The angles of this pixel relative to the equatorial
      plane and reference longitude constitute the latitude and
      longitude of the pixel. For that latitude and longitude, solar
      incidence, emission, and phase angles are determined at a
      surface parallel to the areoid but having a radius from
      planetary center equivalent to that of the surface intercept of
      the shape model. Solar incidence and emission are also
      determined relative to the shape model itself. Using the
      latitude and longitude of the surface intercept of each spatial
      pixel, TES bolometric albedo and thermal inertia are retrieved
      from global map products, and resampled into CRISM sensor space
      using nearest neighbor resampling. The same procedure is used to
      retrieve MOLA elevation, and the local slope magnitude and slope
      azimuth of the MOLA elevation model.
 
      (e) Radiance is converted to I/F by dividing by (pi *
      solar flux at 1 AU * heliocentricdistance^2)). Solar flux is
      maintained in a level 4 CDR, and solar distance is written in the
      label to the radiance image.
 
      (f) I/F is converted to Lambert albedo to allow rapid
      identification of new ROIs and to quickly assess the information
      content of targeted observations. Some or all of the following
      corrections may be made:
 
        I/F is divided by cosine of the solar incidence angle
 
        The estimated contribution to and attenuation of the signal by
        atmospheric aerosols is removed.
 
        The estimated attenuation of the signal by atmospheric aerosols
        is removed.
 
        The thermal emission from longer IR wavelengths is removed.
 
      (g) The multispectral TRDRs are map projected into MRDRs using the
      latitude and longitude information in the DDRs. Because of the
      mosaicked nature of an MRDR, the following protocol is used to
      select between overlapping TRDRs for inclusion in the MRDR:
 
        If radiance is available but not Lambert albedo, the TRDR with
          the lower incidence angle at the areoid is used
 
        If Lambert albedo is available, then:
 
             If both TRDRs have incidence angles &gt;70 degrees, the one
               with the lower incidence angle is used.
 
             If one incidence angle is &gt;70 degrees and one is &lt;70 degrees,
               the TRDR with i &lt; 70 degrees is used.
 
             If both incidence angles are &lt;70 degrees, then the TRDR with
               the lower 440-nm Lambert albedo is used.

      DATA DESCRIPTION:
 
      There is only one data type associated with this volume, the
      Multispectral Reduced Data Records or MRDRs.
 
 
      An MRDR consists of mosaicked, map-projected multispectral TRDRs.
      All data are represented as 32-bit real numbers. The files are
      updated at approximately 14 days after transfer of target ID files,
      when sufficiently accurate pointing information is available. The
      multispectral map RDR contains up to five multiple-band images at
      256 pixels/degree, and two list files.
 
      The first multiple-band image is map-projected radiance without
      any further corrections applied, taken directly from the
      temporary TRDR associated with a strip of multispectral data.
      Although in the TRDRs there are separate multiple-band images
      for the VNIR and IR detectors, in this case the data are merged.
      The size of the multiple-band image varies between map tiles. A
      typical multiple-band image might have 1280 pixels in the
      latitude direction, a variable number of pixels in the longitude
      direction, and approximately 72 pixels in the wavelength
      dimension, representing each of the selected channels in
      multispectral mode.
 
      The second multiple-band image is geometrically identical to the
      map- projected radiance multiple-band image, except that the
      data have been processed using the ADR binary tables to Lambert
      albedo (the thermally-corrected estimated surface contribution
      to reflected I/F, divided by cos i).
 
      The third and fourth multiple-band image contains map-projected
      data from the temporary DDRs associated with a strip of
      multispectral data, used to derive I/F from radiance. The files
      correspond to the mosaicked I/F and Lambert albedo versions of the
      TRDRs respectively. 11 additional layers that are specific to
      individual multispectral strips used to assemble the tile,
      and are thus not contained in the DDR.
 
        Solar longitude, units degrees

        calibration at the spatial pixel of the MRDR
 
        The IR column number carried through from the temporary TRDR
        used to populate the MRDR; this identifies the IR wavelength

        The ordinal number of the frame from the source VNIR TRDR; this
        together with column number, observation ID, and ordinal counter
        provides traceability back to a spatial pixel in a source EDR

        Time of day, hhmm.ss
 
      The fifth multiple-band image contains map-projected summary
      products from the temporary TRDRs associated with a strip of
      multispectral data.
 
      The first listfile, in ASCII format, contains one pair of values
      for every observation ID used to create the tile, the observation
      ID and the SPICE metakernel that described the kernels required
      for its map projection.
 
      The second listfile, also in ASCII format, contains wavelengths
      of each layer in the radiance and I/F images..
 
      In the summary product images there are 45 layers, as follows:

      wavelengths &apos;s&apos; and &apos;l&apos;:  BD(c) = 1 - R(c) / (a*R(s) + b*R(l)),
      where a = 1 - b and b = (lambda(c) - lambda(s)) / (lambda(l) -
      lambda(s))
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      There is one type of ancillary data provided with this
      dataset:
 
      1. The BROWSE directory contains browse images in PNG format.
      See BROWINFO.TXT for more details.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      Areocentric latitude and longitude, incidence, emission, and
      phase angles will be derived from spacecraft attitude, gimbal
      position, pixel location, and MOLA shape model of Mars. The
      detailed procedure is described in the documentation on DDRs.
      The adopted projection convention is planetocentric, positive
      east, using the 2000 IAU prime meridian and pole of rotation.
      The projection varies in 5 degree latitude bands, using
      EQUIRECTANGULAR equatorward of 65 degrees latitude and POLAR
      STEREOGRAPHIC poleward of 65 degrees latitude. For the latitude
      band projected equirectangularly, the center latitude of
      projection is the equatorward boundary of each band to minimize
      distortion. For the latitude bands projected polar
      stereographically, the center of projection is the pole. In the
      north polar region, 0 longitude is down, and in the south polar
      region 0 longitude is up. The planet is divided into 1964 non-
      overlapping, 256 pixel/degree tiles. Their longitude width
      increases poleward to keep tiles approximately the same in area.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      The CRISM archive will be made available online via Web and FTP
      servers.  This will be the primary means of distribution.
      Therefore the archive will be organized as a set of virtual
      volumes, with each data set stored online as a single volume. As
      new data products are released they will be added to the volume&apos;s
      data directory, and the volume&apos;s index table will be updated
      accordingly. The size of the volume will not be limited by the
      capacity of the physical media on which it is stored; hence the
      term virtual volume.  When it is necessary to transfer all or part
      of a data set to other media such as DVD for distribution or for
      offline storage, the virtual volume&apos;s contents will be written to
      the other media according to PDS policy, possibly dividing the
      contents among several physical volumes.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
      All of the uncertainties in the constituent TRDRs and DDRs are
      propagated into the MRDRs. These are described below.
 
      Issues from TRDRs: Overview
      ===========================
 
      Four major sources of uncertainty in the radiance image in TRDRs
      include:
 
      (a) Random noise in the data due to statistical uncertainties in
      counting photons. This is manifested as noisy calibrated data.
      Noise is most significant in darker areas. Typically, the signal
      to noise ratio at &lt;2500 nm is 400 in bright areas and 200 in dark
      areas, in the constituent observations, before pixel binning.
 
      (b) Optical distortion can affect spectra of small-scale features.
      In one column, the projection onto Mars&apos; surface may vary by as
      much as +/-0.4 not-binned detector elements in the XX dimension
      depending on position in the FOV (distortions are worst at the
      edges of the VNIR and IR FOVs). For a single wavelength, its
      location in the ZZ direction may vary by as much as +/-1
      not-binned detector elements depending on wavelength and position
      in the XX direction (distortions are worst at the short- and
      long-wavelength ends of the IR detector). In other words,
      different wavelengths include slightly different combinations
      of signal from spatially adjacent pixels, so that compositional
      interpretations of features near the scale of a pixel are weakly
      wavelength-dependent. Also, wavelengths drifts across the field
      of view. Compositional interpretations based on exact
      wavelengths of absorptions may thus be weakly spatially dependent.
      The resampling approach outlined above can remove much of this
      uncertainty.
 
      To correct for optical distortions, multiband images may be
      resampled in the spectral or spatial direction. Three types of
      resampling may have occurred: (a) resampling in the wavelength
      direction occurs using nearest-neighbor resampling, as coded in
      the PS CDR; (b) resampling in the spatial direction, to remove
      differences in spatial scale with wavelength or band, is done
      with bicubic interpolation using the CM CDR; and (c) VNIR data
      may be rescaled to match the slightly different magnification of
      the IR spectrometer, also using bicubic interpolation and the CM
      CDR. A resampled TRDR is distinguished by values of the keywords
      MRO:SPATIAL_RESAMPLING_FLAG, MRO:SPATIAL_RESCALING_FLAG, and
      MRO:SPECTRAL_RESAMPLING_FLAG.
 
      (c) In order to distinguish spectrally similar minerals that
      have different geological implications for their environments
      of formation, adequate spectral resolution is necessary. This
      requires sufficiently high density spectral sampling, as well
      as a sufficiently narrow full width half maximum (FWHM) of the
      instrument response in the spectral direction. This &apos;slit
      function,&apos; the effective bandpass for a single detector
      element, represents the convolution of spectral sampling and
      the point-spread function in the spectral direction. CRISM&apos;s
      benchmark is distinguishing the minerals montmorillonite and
      kaolinite, which form in hydrothermal environments under
      different temperature regimes [SWAYZEETAL2003]. The requirements
      for this are (a) &lt;20 nm FWHM and (b) sampling of the spectrum
      at this is smaller increments. CRISM&apos;s spectral sampling
      requirement is &lt;10 nm/channel to provide oversampling, and the
      actual performance is better at 6.55 nm/channel. FWHM is 8 nm
      in the VNIR across the FOV. In the IR it increases from 10 nm
      at short wavelengths to 15 nm at the longest wavelengths at the
      center of the FOV, and broadens by about 2 nm at 0.8 degrees
      from the center of the field of view. Outside +/-0.9 degrees
      from the center of the field of view the telescope is slightly
      vignetted, so further degradation is expected at extreme field
      angles. Although the spectral sampling and resolution meet
      requirements, their variation across the field-of-view must be
      accounted for when comparing with rock and mineral analog
      spectra.
 
      (d) There are several instrument artifacts that are corrected in
      the calibration pipeline. Residual errors in the corrections will
      introduce systematic errors into the data. Seven most significant
      artifacts were found early enough during calibration either to be
      corrected or to be characterized sufficiently to be removed during
      post-processing.
 
      First, the boundary of zones 1 and 2 of the VNIR order sorting
      filter is a joint between two distinct glasses with different
      indices of refraction. When illuminated during stage 1 testing
      for linearity, it was found to cause significant (&gt;10%)
      scattered light at shorter wavelengths (&lt;670 nm). This was
      correcting by replacing the VNIR focal plane assembly with the
      flight spare, onto which a narrow black stripe was painted to
      shadow the joint. The black stripe attenuates the light from
      610-710 nm and causes a dip in response at those wavelengths.
      In the processed data, the major effect is that signal to noise
      ratio is decreased.
 
      Second, the linearity of both detectors was found to be
      extraordinarily sensitive to the bias voltage applied. Upon
      discovery of this during detector-level testing, the voltage
      was modified from 5 to 4.8 V to lessen the effect. The residual
      non-linearity is characterized in a level 6 CDR and removed
      during calibration.
 
      Third, CRISM&apos;s gimbal housing has a gap between two segments of
      its planet facing radiator, in order to simultaneously maintain
      the cooler bodies at &gt;248K and the optics at about 213K. During
      ad hoc testing for scattered light (performed by walking a
      flashlight around the gimbal housing with a mounted but
      unaligned VNIR detector), a sneak path for undispersed light
      to the VNIR detector was discovered. This was easily fixed by
      covering the VNIR FPA with thermal blanketing, but the result
      was a heat leak from the FPA to the spectrometer housing,
      raising spectrometer housing temperature to near is maximum
      desired value of -75C. To remediate the heat leak, VNIR
      operating temperature was modified from -20C, intended
      originally, to -60C.
 
      Fourth, the original &apos;open&apos; position for the shutter at step
      0 of 33 was found to create a ghost image of the scene
      approximately 1 degree out of the FOV in the cross-slit direction,
      with a magnitude up to 10-30% of the primary scene. This was
      remediated by a software fix, in which &apos;open&apos; was redefined to
      position 3, which moves the origin of the ghost image to an
      angle further from the FOV at which it is baffled by the
      telescope. Secondary artifacts created by this fix are discussed
      in more detail below.
 
      Fifth, zone 1 of the IR order sorting filter was found to have a
      red leak at &gt;4200 nm, beyond CRISM&apos;s nominal wavelength range but
      within the spectral range at which the detector responds. Hence,
      thermal background is unexpectedly large at 1000-1700 nm in the
      IR. This was discovered too late for redesign of the filter; the
      main effect is decreased - but still high - SNR at the affected
      wavelengths.
 
      Sixth, it was intended originally that the maximum wavelength
      would be 4050 nm - compared to MRO&apos;s requirement of =&gt;3600 nm -
      in order to cover the center of the strong carbonate band at
      3980 nm. Due to tolerances in the manufacturing process, the
      peak response of the zone 3 linearly variable filter was
      mismatched from the peak required for 4050 nm light to fall
      on the detector. The mismatch was greater than the 80-nm bandpass
      of the filter. To maintain responsivity at &gt;2700 nm, a long-
      wavelength cutoff of 3920 nm was accepted to properly align
      the filter with light dispersed from the gratings.
 
      Finally, the spectrometer slit - which defines the mapping of
      wavelengths to detector rows as well as the spatial FOV - is
      mounted on a curved surface whose axis of curvature is parallel
      to the wavelength direction. The slit assembly is fixed with
      pins through holes whose diameters are oversized to provide
      margin for fastening the assembly. During instrument-level
      vibration testing, the slit assembly shifted in the wavelength
      direction by the tolerance in the hole diameters, shifting
      wavelength calibration by about 15 nm in both the VNIR and IR.
      Although vibration testing exceeded expected launch vibrations
      by about 50%, additional shifting of the slit assembly during
      launch cannot be ruled out. If it occurred, it can will be
      calibrated out using the measured positions of Martian
      atmospheric gas absorptions.
 
      All except one of remaining artifacts are relatively minor
      and/or have straightforward (though sometimes tedious)
      corrections, discussed below. The coefficients needed for
      each correction are maintained in a level 4 or level 6 CDR,
      and applied during calibration of EDRs to TRDRs. The leak of
      second order light into the &gt;2800 nm wavelength range of the
      IR detector is the only major correction.
 
      Issues from TRDRs: Electronics Effects
      ======================================
 
      Housekeeping errors: Both responsivity and bias of the VNIR and
      IR detectors have to be corrected for small differences in
      detector temperature between measurements of scenes and
      measurements of internal calibration sources. The required
      detector temperature measurement precision is approximately
      0.3K. Relatively late during calibration, it was found that
      raw values of temperatures telemetered by the IR focal plane
      electronics (including both redundant detector temperatures)
      were being perturbed by up to 2K by changes in current loads
      on the board. These variations in current result from normal
      operations like changing frame rate, running lamps, or running
      a cooler. A large number of ground calibration frames afforded
      many cases in which loads changed while temperature remained
      constant, and these cases occurred over temperatures that span
      the operating range, allowing derivation of the correction of
      telemetry values at each frame rate to their corresponding
      values at 1 Hz. These corrections are maintained in a level 6
      CDR. Errors in this correction will propagate into corrections
      for detector temperature as discussed below.
 
      Electronics ghost: Both detectors, but especially the VNIR
      detector, are subject to a weak ghost image of any illuminated
      spot into its corresponding location in every other of the four
      160-column quadrants of the of the 640-column detector. This is
      a small effect at the &lt;1% level, and is removed by scaling the
      image of each quadrant by an empirically determined value that
      is nonlinearly related to signal level, and then subtracting
      the scaled quadrant image from that of every other quadrant. The
      scale factors are maintained in a level 6 CDR. To the
      uncertainties in measurement, each of the four quadrants in a
      detector behaves only slightly differently. There is a minimal
      effect of frame rate, but ghost magnitude is apparently
      unaffected by detector temperature. Errors in this correction
      could be manifested as anomalously dark or bright spots exactly
      one-fourth of the detector width away (160 samples, 80 2x-binned
      samples, 32 5x-binned samples, or 16 10x-binned samples.
 
      Detector-averaged non-linearity: As mentioned previously, both
      detectors exhibit slightly nonlinear response to input signal.
      This was characterized using a matrix of measurements at each
      frame rate, in which both the level of a well-calibrated light
      source and exposure time were varied. Both types of modulation
      of total signal produce indistinguishable results. This testing
      has been repeated inflight by imaging a focal plane lamp at
      multiple exposure times at each frame rate. Nonlinearity is
      described in a level 6 CDR by a logarithmic function of bias- and
      ghost-corrected DN; corrections for flight data scale DN level by
      the ratio of relative responsivity at that DN to the responsivity
      at a reference DN level. Errors in the linearity correction are
      most likely to be manifested processed data in the following ways:
 
        anomalously high or low value at the extreme wavelengths in
        either the VNIR or IR detector
 
        inaccuracy in the ratio of values at wavelengths inside and
        outside strong absorptions (2700 nm CO2, 3000 nm H2O)
 
      Pixel-dependent non-linearity: At higher frame rates (15 and 30
      Hz), the detector-averaged behavior described above appears
      inadequate to fully characterize nonlinearity, and individual
      pixels exhibit slight variations. These are corrected using known,
      smooth fields of approximately the same brightness as Mars. In
      the IR the onboard integrated sphere provides a sufficiently high
      signal to measure and remove this effect. In the VNIR the sphere&apos;s
      signal is not sufficient at all wavelengths, and instead smeared
      measurements of Mars are used to construct the correction. Errors
      in this correction would appear a systematically low or high
      wavelengths (bands) when observed at a particular detector column.
 
      Issues from TRDRs: Optical Effects
      ==================================
 
      Shutter position irreproducibility. In order to illuminate the
      spectrometer slit&apos;s full 2.12 degree field of view, CRISM&apos;s
      telescope illuminates a circular region of slightly larger
      diameter surrounding the slit. The base of the shutter, on the
      hinge end,  just protrudes into the illuminated area. At
      position 0, originally intended as the &apos;open&apos; position, the
      reflective rear surface of the shutter provides the detectors
      an unbaffled view of the scene approximately 1 degree from the
      center of the field of view in a cross-slit direction, creating
      an out-of-focus &apos;ghost&apos; image of that location. Moving the
      shutter through successive steps redirects the angle from which
      the ghost image originates to further from the center of the FOV.
      At position 3, the angle from which the ghost image originates is
      baffled by the telescope, and the ghost disappears. To remediate
      the ghost image, the open position of the shutter is defined in
      software to position 3.
 
      At position 3 the shutter attenuates up to 10% of the light coming
      from an external scene, depending on the wavelength. The short-
      wavelength  zone of the VNIR grating and the long-wavelength zone
      of the IR grating are blocked preferentially.
      In frames that view the integrating sphere, ratioing successive
      views of the sphere (between which the shutter is moved) creates
      a distinctive wavelength-dependent pattern in which brightness of
      the sphere is non-repeatable by up to a few percent. This is
      explained by a small (about 0.1 degree) non-reproducibility in the
      angle at which the sphere is viewed and the fact that, unlike the
      external scene, the spectrometer&apos;s view of the sphere is vignetted
      by the sphere&apos;s aperture. With a slight shift in shutter position,
      the cone of sphere light entering spectrometer optics shifts. The
      filling of dual zone gratings changes slightly, decreasing
      responsivity at long VNIR wavelengths and short IR wavelengths.
      Also, the shadow of the black strip on the VNIR order-sorting
      filter zone boundary shifts, creating a distinctive trough and
      peak pattern at detector rows 222-235 (approximately 605-690 nm).
 
      Because this effect is so characteristic as a function of
      wavelength, it is easily correctable. Ratios of different sphere
      observations during ground calibration are used to create a
      multiplicative correction to a sphere image as a function of
      wavelength, that is maintained in a level 4 CDR. In flight data
      to be corrected, the magnitude of the peak near VNIR row 235 is
      measured. The correction is scaled by the magnitude of the peak,
      and it is multiplied by the data. The VNIR row 235 peak is used
      to scale the corrections for both the VNIR and IR. Errors in
      this correction would lead to high or low values especially
      at 600-700 nm, with the error being systematic within
      a group of observations processed using a single sphere
      observation, but random between such groups of observations.
      Put differently, the systematic errors would change every few
      orbits.
 
      To the limits of measurement error, the small irreproducibility
      of shutter position at the &apos;open&apos; position has no measurable
      effect on external scene data.
 
      IR second order leakage: Zone 3 of the IR order sorting filter
      admits up to 3% of the 2nd order light from the grating, at
      wavelengths 1400-1950 nm, that falls at detector rows whose
      nominal wavelengths are 2800-3900 nm. The leakage peaks at a
      nominal wavelength of 3400 nm. Due to the falloff of both the
      solar spectrum and the Martian reflectance spectrum with
      increasing wavelength, the relative magnitude of the leakage
      to the signal in zone 3 is enhanced so that it becomes tens
      of percent of the total signal in that wavelength range.
 
      Ground testing provided sufficient data for an empirical
      correction for this effect, in which scaled values of signal at
      second-order wavelengths are subtracted from first-order
      (nominal) wavelengths. The correction is maintained in a level 4
      CDR. Errors in this correction would be manifested in processed
      data as a negative positive additive component to the values
      from 2760-3920 nm, centered and strongest at 3400 nm.
 
      Issues from TRDRs: Temperature Effects
      ======================================
 
      Bad pixels: The IR detector is operated at cryogenic temperature
      to minimize dark current and bias level of the detector. With
      increasing detector temperature, not all pixels accrue an
      elevated bias level or dark current - the latter of which adds
      noise due to its electron counting statistics - at the same rate.
      The most susceptible pixels, within which effective SNR or
      available  dynamic range are adversely impacted, are
      &apos;bad pixels.&apos; Bad pixels are identified routinely during
      internal calibrations, and recorded in level 4 CDRs. In the
      contruction of TRDRs, bad pixels are interpolated over. The
      effect on processed data is local wavelength-dependent
      &apos;blurring,&apos; but the locations are known in the bad pixel masks.
      Appearance of a new bad pixel not recorded in a level 4 CDR would
      result in an anomalous and/or noisy value at a particular
      wavelength (band) at the same detector column (sample)
      position.
 
      Bias levels: Bias is the response of the detector to zero input
      signal from light or thermal background, and includes two
      components. One component is a fixed pattern that varies
      pixel-to-pixel +/-25 14-bit DN&apos;s, and has a weak columnar
      organization. The second component is a step function of
      about 20 14-bit-DNs that occurs at some row of the detector.
      The row at which this occurs moves systematically with frame
      integration time.
 
      The fixed-pattern component of bias depends on frame rate,
      differing by about 100 14-bit DNs between frame rates. It also
      varies with detector temperature and temperature of the focal
      plane electronics. To the limits of measurement uncertainty, the
      temperature dependence itself is independent of quadrant or frame
      rate.
 
      Bias is routinely measured via dedicated calibrations and recorded
      in level 4 CDRs, and is adjusted for changes in detector or focal
      plane electronics temperature based on telemetered temperatures,
      using scaling factors maintained in level 6 CDRs. The step
      function is modeled and removed using a function described in a
      6 CDR.
 
      Errors in the temperature corrections to bias would be manifested
      in processed data as a negative positive additive component to the
      values at all wavelengths. Errors in removal of the step function
      would be manifested in processed data as systematically positive
      or negative feature at the same wavelength (band) position at all
      spatial (sample) positions.
 
      Sphere radiance: Under closed-loop control, the brightness of
      either of the integrating sphere&apos;s lamps is measured by a Si
      photodiode that adjusts current up or down to reach a commandable
      brightness goal. The responsivity of the Si in the photodiode is
      affected by temperature at &gt;900 nm, becoming more sensitive to
      light at warmer temperatures. So, as sphere temperature increases
      and the Si becomes more photosensitive, the same commanded goal
      requires less lamp current. Sphere radiance is modeled based on
      ground calibration at different operating temperatures, which were
      measured by comparing against stable external sources. Output
      radiance for each sphere bulb at the commanded brightness goal
      is calculated at every pixel of each detector as a function of
      telemetered sphere temperature; model coefficients are maintained
      in level 4 CDRs.
 
      Errors in the basic sphere model will be manifested in processed
      data as errors in the long wavelength-scale shape of the
      spectrum. Errors in the temperature correction will appear
      similarly, and will be most significant at shorter wavelengths.
 
      Detector responsivity: Both the VNIR and IR detectors exhibit
      dependence of their spectral responsivities on detector
      temperature. In the VNIR detector, the +/-1K thermostatic cycling
      of the detector heater on the timescale of minutes affects
      responsivity at &gt;900 nm by up to a few percent, due to the
      temperature-dependence of Si photosensitivity at those
      wavelengths. These differences in responsivity are corrected
      using a function of telemetered detector temperature, whose
      coefficients are maintained in a level 4 CDR. Errors in this
      correction will appear in processed data as systematically too
      high or too low values at &gt;900 nm, more so at the longer
      wavelengths.
 
      In the IR detector, the longest wavelengths (especially zone 3)
      exhibit a cyclical pattern of responsivity variation as a
      function of wavelength. The pattern is interpreted as Fabry-Perot
      fringes due to interference by long-wavelength light that
      penetrates the HgCdTe detector material which - at those
      wavelengths - is only a few wavelengths thick. The pattern shifts
      systematically as a function of detector temperature due to
      thermal expansion of the detector material, creating
      responsivity differences at about the 5% level. The change in
      temperature required to introduce these artifacts at the level
      of noise in the data is near 0.25K. To correct for this, the
      sphere will be measured repeatedly as detector temperature changes,
      and the sphere used as a relatively stable reference against
      which to calibrate out these effects. Errors in this correction
      will lead to residual, high spectral frequency (about 25-nm
      period) ripples in the values at 2760-3920 nm.
 
      Issues from TRDRs: Post-calibration Corrections
      ===============================================
 
      In data calibrated to Lambert albedo, atmospheric conditions
      are assumed for a given latitude, longitude, solar longitude,
      and elevation, based on TES climatology. Actual weather
      conditions, especially aerosol composition and abundance, may
      vary. The pronounced artifacts of errors in the assumed
      atmospheric conditions are errors in spectral slope and in the
      depth and shape of absorption features due to water ice near
      1.4, 1.9, and 3 microns.
 
      Known Issues with Current VNIR Radiometric Calibration (version 2)
      ==================================================================
 
      Version 2 has been validated using observations of the MER Spirit and
      Opportunity landing sites, with PANCAM measurements that were modeled
      at the top of the atmosphere using CRISM viewing geometry and solar
      longitude. Five artifacts or data quality concerns remain.
 
      (a) Radiance at &lt;410 nm is typically low, because there is not much
      signal at those wavelengths and they are most susceptible to artifacts
      from scattered light subtraction.
 
      (b) Some artifact at the wavelengths of the filter zone boundary. In
      some parts of the field of view at sharp brightness contrasts it
      extends to 644-684 nm.
 
      (c) Scenes with large coverage by ice, especially near either edge of
      the field of view, have more significant artifacts from the scattered
      light correction because, unlike typical Martian soils, ice has
      significant UV reflectance and that decreases accuracy of the
      correction. Typical effects may include degradation at wavelengths
      below 480 nm and above 1010 nm.
 
      (d) Due to spectral smile, mineralogic absorptions located where
      instrument response varies steeply with wavelength exhibit variation
      with field angle. This is most prominent with Fe mineral
      absorptions near 900 nm.
 
      Known Issues with Current IR Radiometric Calibration (version 2)
      ================================================================
 
      Version 2 has been validated using OMEGA observations of
      overlapping regions, attempting correction for atmospheric gas
      absorptions on dusty terrain and observing the residuals, and
      observations of Phobos and Deimos. Major known calibration issues
      have been closed out with one exception.
 
      Due to spectral smile, mineralogic absorptions located where
      instrument response varies steeply with wavelength exhibit variation
      with field angle. This is most prominent at the edge of atmospheric
      gas absorptions near 1400 and 2000 nm.
 
      Summary of VNIR and IR &apos;bad channels&apos;
      =====================================
 
      The following channels can be routinely excluded:
      VNIR: wavelengths less than 410, 644-684, greater than 1023 nm
      IR: wavelengths less than 1021 nm, 2694 and 2701 nm, and greater
      than 3924 nm
 
      The following channels may be &apos;degraded&apos; and their quality is
      observation-dependent. Caution is recommended but the data
      may be valid.
 
      VNIR:
 
      Wavelengths less than 442 nm (due to artifacts from scattered
      light correction in very contrasty scenes)
 
      Wavelengths greater than or equal to 970 nm (radiances are
      observed to misalign with IR radiances; the reason is uncertain
      but may be related to uncorrected effects of beamsplitter
      temperature)
 
      IR:
 
      Wavelengths less than 1047 nm radiances are
      observed to misalign with IR radiances; the reason is uncertain
      but may be related to uncorrected effects of beamsplitter
      temperature)
 
      Wavelengths 2660-2800 nm (the reason is uncertain but may be due
      to problems with correction of water vapor in measurements of the
      ground calibration sources)
 
      Wavelengths greater than 3700 nm (there is a scene dependent
      turndown in radiances beyond 3700 nm due to unknown causes)
 
      Issues from DDRs
      ================
 
      The major sources of uncertainty in DDRs arise from uncertainties
      in instrument pointing knowledge, from coverage of the MOLA data
      set, and from the scale of the TES data.
 
      The formal pointing uncertainty for the CRISM gimbal plane is 1
      mrad each in the spacecraft yaw(z), roll(x), or pitch/gimbal(y)
      axes. The formal uncertainty in reconstructed spacecraft
      attitude is similar. Uncertainty in CRISM&apos;s gimbal attitude is
      negligible, about 0.006 mrad. The formal error in projection
      onto the surface surface location depends on the angle of the
      gimbal and typically is of order several hundreds of meters.
      Early experience during the first few months of operations
      suggests that the actual errors are smaller than expected formal
      errors, so that typical error in surface location are 200 meters
      or less.
 
      Latitude and longitude are described by the intersection of
      CRISM field of view with the MOLA shape model. Given the
      uncertainties in location of a point on the surface, expected
      uncertainty near the equator is of the order of 0.005 degrees.
      Uncertainties in incidence, emission, and phase angles relative
      to the areoid are similar.
 
      Errors in incidence and emission angle relative to the MOLA
      shape model are dominated by the lower sampling density of the
      shape model. MOLA points are typically a few hundred meters
      apart. This compares to CRISM&apos;s sampling scale of 15 to 200
      meters per spatial pixel, depending on instrument configuration.
      In areas of smooth topography the errors are small, but in areas
      with topography that is rough at scales less than a few hundred
      meters, uncertainty is several degrees. The same uncertainties
      apply to slope magnitude.
 
      Errors in bolometric albedo and thermal inertia will have a
      large contribution from the different scales of the CRISM and
      TES data sets. The TES data from which these values are
      retrieved are sampled at 8 pixels per degree, yet depending on
      instrument configuration, the native spatial sampling of the
      CRISM data set is 256-4096 pixels per degree. Thus in areas with
      heterogeneous surface properties, large errors in bolometric
      albedo and thermal inertia may occur.
 
      Known Issues with DDR Accuracy
      ==============================
 
      The only known major problem with DDRs generated using software
      version 1.9 is that TES bolometric albedo and thermal inertia
      layers remain unpopulated.
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set will be examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The
      peer review will be conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      For each observation, every EDR is compared against frame-by-frame
      predictions of commanded instrument state. The results of the
      comparison are written as a data validation report that
      accompanies the EDRs for that observation.
 
      In the case of a hardware or configuration discrepancy (shutter
      position, lamp status or level, pixel binning, frame rate, channel
      selection, power status of detectors), processing of the image
      data to TRDR level does not occur in order to avoid introducing
      invalid results, and DDRs are not created. Therefore no
      &apos;invalid&apos; data should no get incorporated into an MRDR. Also,
      missing frames or portions of frames are replaced with a value
      of 65535 (this cannot be a valid data value). That portion of
      the EDR is not further processed, and it also is propagated to a
      value of 65535 in all layers of the TRDR. When incorporated into
      an MRDR it will be flagged as 65535 until overwritten.
 
      Only a subset of instrument configurations represent &apos;scene&apos; data,
      as indicated by the keyword MRO:ACTIVITY_ID. Only scene data
      aimed at Mars get processed into TRDRs, have corresponding DDRs,
      and get incorporated into MRDRs.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
