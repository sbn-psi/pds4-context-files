  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains high time resolution magnetic field vectors
    acquired by the Galileo magnetometer (MAG). It includes both
    satellite flyby and non-flyby data. These data were acquired in
    order to characterize various portions of the Jovian magnetosphere
    at high time resolution. The Galileo Magnetospheres Working Group
    (MWG) collectively acquired high time resolution data for short
    intervals in order to try and regain some of the magnetospheric
    science lost due to the low data rates of the phase 2 mission (no
    high gain antenna) mission. These observations are scattered in
    Jovian distance, local time, System III longitude, etc. in order
    to provide some insight into processes that may be active in
    different regions of the magnetosphere.
 
    There were a few orbits in which MAG obtained high-resolution
    coverage in conjunction with remote sensing (typically NIMS)
    observations. Regular MWG high-resolution observations were
    recorded to tape using the 7.68 bits/second Low-Rate Science and
    Plasma Wave (LPW) tape mode. Observations using higher tape speed
    modes included recorded LPW rate data as well. In cases where the
    coverage provided was adequate, and when there was sufficient
    bits-to-ground (BTG) allocation to return them, these &apos;ridealong&apos;
    observations provided coverage in addition to the regular MWG
    observations. A list of ridealong recordings is provided in the
    &apos;Data Coverage and Quality&apos; section of this document.
 
    Satellite Flybys: One of the primary objectives of the Galileo
    mission was to characterize the magnetic signatures of Jupiter&apos;s
    Galilean satellites, determine their sources, and study their
    interactions with the Jovian system. In particular, confirming
    the presence of a sub-surface ocean on Europa became a major
    focus of the Europa Mission (GEM). The Millennium Mission (GMM)
    also included a flyby of Amalthea.
 
    Inner Magnetosphere: Characterizing the Io torus was a high
    priority goal of the MWG throughout the mission. In order to
    protect the spacecraft and instrument from the high radiation
    of the inner magnetosphere, most of the inner magnetosphere
    observations were deferred until late in GEM and GMM.
 
    Middle Magnetosphere: In the middle magnetosphere, a variety of
    observations were made in order to characterize the distribution
    of plasma in the plasma sheet and to examine the regions where
    field lines likely map to the auroral oval.
 
    Magnetotail: Another of the MWG high priority science objectives
    was to study the structure of the Jovian magnetotail. Orbit C09
    was specifically designed to meet this objective. Apojove was
    near 150 Rj at local midnight. High time resolution data was
    acquired for five intervals at various distances and local times.
 
    Table 1. gives information on the coverage provided by the various
    MAG high time resolution observations. In addition to start time
    and duration, the table describes the minimum and maximum distance
    from the spacecraft to Jupiter, and the local hour and Sys. 3 west
    longitude (WLON) of the spacecraft at the beginning and end of the
    recorded interval. Local hour is given in terms of decimal hours
    (0.0-23.9). WLON is in units of degrees (0-359).

  Processing
  ==========
    The processing of MAG data is performed as a series of operations
    on the data.
      1) Extract raw MAG and Attitude and Articulation and Control
         System (AACS) data from the packetized telemetry files. Set
         sample time tags, sort data on time, and remove duplicate
         samples.
      2) Remove the calibration estimate applied by the instrument.
         This involves multiplying the data by the inverse of the
         onboard geometry matrix, dividing by gain factors, and
         adding offsets to the data. This returns the data to
         sensor coordinates.
      3) Apply post orbit inflight calibration (scale to nT,
         subtract offsets, multiply by coupling matrix). This properly
         orients the data in the spinning spacecraft reference frame.
      4) Merge in the AACS data, interpolate to MAG sample times,
         correct the phase angle for phase delays in the instrument
         and despin the data into IRC coordinates.
      5) Transform data into geophysical coordinates using SPICE
         based software and SPICE kernels.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Sampling
    -------------
      The magnetometer samples the field thirty times per second. These
      data are recursively filtered and decimated down to a sample rate
      of two vectors per minor frame (mf = 2/3 second) before being
      recorded to tape in LPW format. For all orbits except G01 and G02,
      the MAG data are evenly sampled in time, 3 samples per second. Due
      to an instrument programming error that occurred during the
      instrument reprogramming for phase 2 operations, the G01 and G02
      LPW data are unevenly sampled in time within the minor frames.
      Each minor frame consists of 10 real-time interrupts (RTI). In the
      G01 and G02 data, the mid minor frame sample occurs half an RTI
      later than it should. This problem was corrected before the C03
      orbit.
 
      All data are time stamped with universal time (UT) at the
      spacecraft when the instrument sampled data within the
      recursive filter.
 
      MAG uses fixed gains to acquire data [KIVELSONETAL1992]. Gain
      states must be manually changed by sending a gain change
      command to the instrument. There are 3 ranges of field strengths
      that the instrument can measure:
 
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      Table 3. Magnetometer Ranges
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      Field Range (nT)     Magnetometer, field range
        min      max
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
        1/64  -    32      Outboard low field
         1/4  -   512      Outboard high field, Inboard low field
           8  - 16384      Inboard high field
 
      Recursive filtering of LPW data makes the apparent digitization
      step size much smaller than it appears in Table 3. Variation in
      the vector field components attributable to the spacecraft spin
      reduces the effective digitization levels in the filtered data to
      about one quarter of the A/D step size.
 
      The outboard magnetometer, low field mode was used to acquire
      data beyond 60 Rj and the inboard magnetometer, high field
      mode was used to acquire data inside of 9 Rj. During the prime
      mission, the both the inboard low field and the outboard high
      field modes were used to acquire data between 9-60 Rj. As the
      outboard magnetometer is further out from the main body of the
      spacecraft on the boom than the inboard magnetometer it is impacted
      less by spacecraft fields. For this reason it was initially
      preferred over the inboard magnetometer. However, the outboard
      magnetometer began to experience abrupt changes in the sensor zero
      levels towards the end of the prime mission. As a result, the
      inboard magnetometer, low field mode was used to acquire data
      between 9-60 Rj throughout the remainder of the mission.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The data are provided in four (4) coordinate systems (IRC, System
    III, satellite centered &apos;planetographic&apos;, and Phi-Omega). For moon
    flybys, data are provided all four of these coordinate systems.
    For non-flyby observations only IRC and System III coordinates are
    provided. Data from each coordinate system are stored in separate
    files with simple ASCII table formats. The structure and contents
    of the data files are described below. The coordinate systems are
    described later in this document in the section entitled
    &apos;Coordinate Systems.&apos;

      Galileo NAV team during the mission. All of the SPICE kernels used
      to produce this data set are contained on the MWG archive volume
      DVD in the EXTRAS/SPICE/KERNELS directory.
 
      The kernels (PDS PRODUCT_ID) used to create this were:

  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    There are several files that are provided in addition to the data
    files themselves that may be of value to the user. These include
    a table of important spacecraft and instrument events including
    onboard calibration parameters, an instrument calibration table,
    a description of instrument anomalies and resolutions, and a set
    of quick-look or &apos;browse&apos; plots of the data.
 
    Due to bit rate limitations some of the targetted satellite flybys
    had no high-resolution recordings associated with them. For these
    and a few distant flybys data are provided in satellite-centered
    coordinates at the RTS data rate. Included are Europa flybys in
    E19 and I25, Ganymede flybys in C9 and E12, and Callisto flybys
    in C21, C22, and C23. The C20 Callisto flyby was lost due to a
    telemetry outage. While these data are part of Survey Data Set,
    they are ancillary to this data set.
 
 
  Coordinate Systems
  ==================
    The data are provided in four coordinate systems. Data are
    provided in the spacecraft coordinate system in order to aid in
    the interpretation of particle instrument data. The other three
    coordinate systems provided for use in Jovian magnetospheric
    studies.
 
    Inertial Rotor Coordinates (IRC)
    --------------------------------
      The IRC coordinate system takes the basic rotor coordinate system
      (Y along the boom, Z opposite the high gain antenna) which is
      spinning, and despins it using the rotor spin angle. For this
      reason IRC coordinates are sometimes referred to as &apos;despun
      spacecraft coordinates.&apos; In this system, Z still points along the
      spin axis opposite the HGA (or roughly anti-Earthward), X is
      approximately parallel to the downward ecliptic normal, and Y
      completes the right-handed set (pointing roughly towards dawn).
 
    System III [1965] Coordinates (SYS3)
    ------------------------------------
      System III [1965] (SYS3) magnetic field vector components form
      the standard right-handed spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a
      Jupiter centered system. Namely, R is radial (along the line from
      the center of Jupiter to the center of the spacecraft), and
      positive away from Jupiter. Phi, the azimuthal component, is
      parallel to the Jovigraphic equator (Omega x R) and positive in
      the direction of corotation. Theta, the &apos;southward&apos; component,
      completes the right-handed set.
 
      For SYS3 trajectory both east and west longitudes are provided.
      West longitudes are related to east longitudes by to the
      algorithm:
 
        west longitude = 360. - east longitude &lt;degrees&gt;
 
      West longitude is defined such that it appears to increase with
      time for a stationary observer [DESSLER1983]. Note, however, that
      R, latitude, and west longitude constitute a left handed set. The
      SYS3 1965 prime meridian is the sub-Earth longitude of
      1965-01-01 00:00 UT. The spin rate (which was determined from the
      rotation rate of the magnetic field) is 9 hrs 55 min 29.719 sec.
      (See [DESSLER1983] for a discussion on Jovian longitude). R is the
      radial (Jupiter&apos;s center to spacecraft center) distance. Latitude
      is planetocentric.
 
    Satellite-Centered Planetographic (Right Handed) Coordinates (SPRH)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
      SPRH is a spherical &apos;planetocentric&apos; coordinate system, centered
      at the satellite. The magnetic field components are the standard
      right-handed spherical triad: R, Theta, and Phi. R is radial
      (along the line from the center of the satellite to the center of
      the spacecraft), and positive away from the satellite. Phi, the
      azimuthal component, is parallel to the satellite&apos;s
      planetographic equator (Omega x R) and positive in a right-handed
      sense. Theta, the &apos;southward&apos; component, completes the
      right-handed set. Trajectory components are also right-handed.
      Since all of the satellites studied are nearly phase locked to
      Jupiter, the SPRH prime meridian is effectively the sub-Jupiter
      meridian. More precise definitions are provided by the IAU [1994]
      (see Table 4). Longitude is measured from the prime meridian and
      is positive in a right-handed sense (see figure below). R is the
      radial distance (satellite&apos;s center to spacecraft center).
      Latitude is planetocentric.

    Satellite Phi-Omega Coordinates (PHIO)
    --------------------------------------
      The PhiO (Satellite Phi=X, Omega=Z) fixed coordinate system is
      defined by using the two vectors Phi, the corotation velocity
      vector at the satellite, and Omega, the Jovian spin axis. Phi is
      positive in the direction of corotation and Omega is positive
      northward. Y completes the right-handed set (pointing towards
      Jupiter). The basis vectors of the coordinate system are fixed at
      the epoch time (satellite closest approach, see Table 2). The
      spacecraft trajectory information takes the instantaneous range
      vector (R) from the satellite center to the spacecraft and
      resolves it into XYZ components. Ranges are given in units of
      satellite radii (see Table 4).

  Review
  ======
    These data have been reviewed by the instrument team and are of
    the highest quality that can be generated at this time. Science
    results based on some of these data have been published in several
    journals (Science, JGR, etc.). After submission to PDS, these data
    successfully completed the peer review process.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    This data set contains the high time resolution magnetometer data.
    The data are highly discontinuous due to bit rate limitations of
    the spacecraft. High time resolution data could only be acquired
    over brief intervals in each orbit and never for more than a few
    hours at a time. Individual recorded intervals are provided in
    separate files. While every attempt has been made to insure that
    the data within each observation are complete and as gap-free as
    possible, some gaps still do exist. The most common causes for
    these are communication outages between the spacecraft and the
    Galileo ground system, and data corruption due to spikes or MAG
    calibration exercises. A listing of the larger gaps and their
    causes (if known) is provided in the MAG gap listing file that
    is associated with this data set. More data coverage information
    (including information for scheduled observations for which there
    was no MAG coverage) is provided in Table 1 above.
 
    The data quality is variable. This data set spans the entire
    mission and contains data segments recorded in many different
    instrument modes. Both calibration and digitization step size vary
    from mode to mode and observation to observation. Information
    regarding instrument mode and calibration used for particular
    observations is provided in the MAG high-resolution data calibration
    file.
 
    As mentioned above, there were a few orbits in which MAG was able
    extend it&apos;s coverage with ridealong recordings. A list of these
    ridealong recordings is given in Table 5 below.

  Product Versions
  ================
    The following table describes the various versions of the data
    files.

    ID       Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
     1       original release
     2       SYS3 coordinate file was modified to include both east and
             west longitude columns; a variety of changes were made to
             record formats
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Signals at the spin period (~19 seconds) or its higher order
    harmonics are most likely instrumental.
 
    The primary source of field uncertainty is in the sensor offsets
    (zero levels plus s/c field). Incorrect zero levels appear as a DC
    shift in the spin aligned sensor, and first harmonic of the spin
    period in the spin plane sensors. Incorrect removal of the
    spacecraft field appears as first harmonic in the spin aligned
    sensor, and higher order harmonics in the spin plane sensors.
 
    Spin plane field components are reliable to better than 1/4 of the
    digitization step size of each mode. The uncertainty in the spin
    axis component is probably between 1/3 and 1/2 the digitization
    step size. While the resulting uncertainty is &gt;.1 nT for most
    modes, the large digitization step size of the inboard high field
    modes can result in spin tones of above 1 nT.
 
    In addition to the more general limitations, the following apply
    to individual orbits or observations.

      G01-GAN/  Data are unevenly sampled in time. Caution must be used
      G01-PSX/  when analyzing the spectra.
      G02-GAN/

      C03-CALL  The data for this observation are NOT well calibrated.
                The magnetometer sensors appear to have failed to lock
                into place correctly. As a result the calibration
                appears to be changing. This anomaly reduces the
                confidence in the sensor geometry on the order of a
                degree or two. There are of course still the common
                errors associated sensor zero levels and quantization.
                In order to minimize the effects of these uncertainties,
                the data have been averaged to two seconds using a
                centered 20 second averaging window. The net error in
                the average is on the order of a few tenths of a
                nanoTesla per component. As a side effect of the
                averaging all of the higher frequency signals have been
                eliminated.
 
      E12-EUR   Due to unexpectedly large magnetic field strength, some
                of the magnetometer data was corrupted due to instrument
                saturation. The problem occurs 1997-Dec-16 11:53:00 -
                12:05:20. The corrupted data have been recovered by
                identifying the bad data in the spinning reference
                frame, then simultaneously fitting a sine and cosine to
                the remaining data to reproduce the spinning signature.
                Note that this technique only recovers oscillations with
                frequencies lower than the spin frequency. For more
                information on the recovery process refer to the file
                /CALIB/MAG/MAG_SATURATION.TXT.
 
      C21-PJOV/ The AACS data for these recordings were seriously
      C22-PJOV/ corrupted and required special processing to correct.
      C23-PJOV  The rotor twist, and spin angles were corrected by
                discarding the LPW rate data, and interpolating the RTS
                rate data. Rotor right ascension (RA) and declination
                (DEC) have been handled differently in each case. For
                C21-PJOV RA and DEC have been set to a fixed value. For
                C22-PJOV RA and DEC have been restricted to a limited
                set of the most common values. For C23-PJOV the LPW rate
                values have been discarded and the RTS rate data has
                been interpolated. While the corrections to the AACS
                appear to have improved the quality of the MAG data,
                some uncertainty still exists. In particular a few clear
                problems are still evident in the spin plane components
                of the magnetic field (the x and y components in despun
                spacecraft coordinates) of C21-PJOV. Special care should
                be taken in the use of all of these data. Please note,
                however, that as the field magnitude may be treated with
                much less suspicion than the field components, as the
                magnitude is unaffected by changes in the spacecraft
                attitude.
 
      A34-PSX7/ The AACS data for this recording was seriously corrupted
      A34-AMA   and required special processing to correct. The rotor
                twist and spin angles were corrected by first correcting
                the &apos;rotor spin delta&apos; which was downlinked from the
                spacecraft. The spin delta was corrected by setting
                bad values to within 0.0002 radians (1 DN) of the
                average. This new spin delta was then used to regenerate
                the rotor twist and spin angles. The RA and DEC were
                corrected by removing spikes and interpolating the
                between the remaining good points. As with other data
                with corrected AACS, the corrections appear to have
                improved the quality of the MAG data, but some
                uncertainty still exists. Special care should be taken
                in the use of these data. The field magnitude may be
                treated with much less suspicion than the field
                components, as the magnitude is unaffected by changes in
                the spacecraft attitude.
 
      A34-AMA   As anticipated the MAG instrument saturated during the
                A34-AMA recording period. A special matrix (without
                crossterms) was used to prevent cross-contamination of
                one sensor due to saturation in another sensor. However,
                due to the rapidly increasing field strength through
                this observation the saturation recovery method used at
                E12-EUR was inadequate. To obtain these data please
                contact the instrument team.
