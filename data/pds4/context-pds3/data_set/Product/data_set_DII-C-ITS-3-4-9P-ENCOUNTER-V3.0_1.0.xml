  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains calibrated images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 acquired
    by the Deep Impact Target Sensor (ITS) after the impactor was released
    from the flyby spacecraft on 03 July 2005.
 
    Version 3.0 was calibrated by the EPOXI mission pipeline and includes
    corrected observation times and a revision to how the camera&apos;s
    compressed zero-DN lookup table entry is decoded. The EPOXI pipeline
    corrected the interpretation of microsecond counter of the spacecraft
    clocks which introduced maximum errors of about 40 milliseconds in the
    earlier Versions 2.0 and 1.0 of this dataset that were produced by the
    Deep Impact pipeline. The EPOXI pipeline was also changed to decompress
    the visual CCD camera&apos;s zero-DN lookup table entry to the top of its
    range, which is 350 DN, and flag the affected pixels as saturated.
    Finally for Version 3.0, the I-over-F data products archived in Version
    2.0 were replaced by multiplicative constants supplied in the headers
    for converting radiance products to I-over-F, and the EPOXI convention
    for constructing PRODUCT_IDs and data file names was used. For more
    information see the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document in this
    dataset and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].

  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this
    dataset were generated in late 2013 by the EPOXI data pipeline,
    maintained by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell
    University.  Known limitations and deficiencies of the pipeline and
    the resulting data are discussed in the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline
    Summary document in this dataset and by Klaasen, et al. (2013)
    [KLAASENETAL2011] and in &apos;Deep Impact Instrument Calibration&apos; by
    Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
    For each CCD image, the pipeline generates two types of calibrated
    products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the
        mnemonic &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be
        reversible because the calibration steps can be backed out to
        return to the original, raw data numbers.  A RADREV image can
        be converted to unitless I-over-F by multiplying by the value
        assigned to the DATA_TO_IOVERF_MULTIPLIER keyword in the PDS
        label.  Alternatively, a RADREV image can be converted from
        radiance units to calibrated data numbers by multiplying by the
        value assigned to the DATA_TO_DN_MULTIPLIER in the PDS label.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the
        mnemonic &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be
        irreversible because the calibration steps, such as smoothing
        over bad pixels, cannot easily be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.  A RAD image can be converted
        to unitless I-over-F by multiplying by the value assigned to
        the DATA_TO_IOVERF_MULTIPLIER keyword in the PDS label.
        Alternatively, a RAD image can be converted from radiance units to
        calibrated data numbers by multiplying by the value assigned to
        the DATA_TO_DN_MULTIPLIER in the PDS label (though interpolated
        pixels will not be real data).  Please note that values in the
        overclock rows and columns bordering the active CCD area are
        set to 0 in the RAD product.
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes, in the
    order listed, on the raw FITS data to produce the RADREV and
    RAD products found in this dataset (the process uses the image
    mode and filter to select the appropriate set of calibration files):
 
      - Decompression of compressed raw images (compression was performed
        on board the spacecraft and the resulting data were downlinked)
      - Correction for bias
      - Subtraction of a dark frame
      - Removal of horizontal, instrumental striping; this step was
        *not* applied to the calibrated images in this dataset because
        the science team determined this step degraded the images; to
        indicate destriping was not performed, RMSTRIPE is set to F (false)
        in the FITS headers and all values in the DESTRIPE extension are
        set to 0
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk
      - Application of a normalized flat field
      - Removal of CCD transfer smear
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV)
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust
      - Calculation of multiplicative factors to convert a RADREV or RAD
        image to I-over-F
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps (missing pixels were identified when the raw FITS files
        were created).
 
    The pipeline also created a FITS image extension to capture the
    signal-to-noise ratio map and another extension to capture the values
    used to remove horizontal striping.  The calibration steps and files
    applied to each raw image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT
    keyword in the PDS data label.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit
      contains the two-dimensional CCD image which is followed by two
      image extensions that are two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel maps
      providing additional information about the CCD image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte consisting of eight,
          single-bit flags to describe the quality of each pixel
          in the primary image.  The PDS data label defines the
          purpose of each single-bit flag.
 
        - The second extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
        - The third extension contains the two columns of DN values that
          were subtracted from every non-overclock column in the left
          and right halves of the primary image array by the stripe
          removal process.  However for all images in this dataset,
          all values in the DESTRIPE extension are set to 0 because
          this step was not applied.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a data label and provides more information about the FITS primary
      image and the extensions.  Many values in a data label were
      extracted from FITS image header keywords which are defined in the
      document EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files is
      IVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;IV&apos; identifies the ITS
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For this dataset,
      all frames numbers (nnn) are 001 because only one frame was
      commanded for each exposure ID.
 
      This convention is the one used by the EPOXI pipeline to construct
      data product file names and PRODUCT_IDs.  To translate between the
      EPOXI and Deep Impact conventions, refer to the
      ITS_TRANSLATE_PRODUCT_ID.LBL and ITS_TRANSLATE_PRODUCT_ID.TAB
      files located in the DOCUMENT directory of this dataset.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All calibrated data products are uncompressed.  If an associated
      raw data product was compressed on board the impactor spacecraft
      (and thus received on the ground and archived as compressed) then
      the calibration pipeline used one of four 8-bit lookup tables to
      decompress the raw image.  For more information, see the EPOXI
      Calibration Pipeline Summary document as well as Hampton, et al.
      (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005], Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006]
      and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when it is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      Using this convention for ITS Tempel 1 approach images, ecliptic
      East is toward the left, ecliptic North is up, and the Sun is to
      the right.  This was also the convention used when displaying ITS
      images of Tempel 1 in published papers.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation of ITS in-flight images with
      those from ground-based calibrations and from the High and Medium
      Resolution Instrument CCDs (HRIV and MRI, respectively), see the
      quadrant nomenclature section in Klaasen, et al. (2008)
      [KLAASENETAL2006].

          9  FFD       1024  1024    Full-frame diagnostic, shuttered
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the impactor
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The timing and geometric parameters included in the data labels and
    FITS headers were computed using the final version of the kernel
    files archived in the Deep Impact SPICE dataset DI-C-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this data set were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset was peer reviewed and certified for scientific use on
    21 March 2014.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this dataset.
 
    Any dark horizontal patches or stripes through some images indicate
    missing data. The image quality map extension identifies where pixels
    are missing. If the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the
    image quality map is turned on, then data for the corresponding image
    pixel is missing. For more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS
    document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second uncertainty between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations and an uncertainty of about one half of a
      second between the clocks on the flyby and impactor spacecraft.
      These improved kernels were included in the DI SPICE data set
      and were used to calculate the geometric parameters in the PDS
      data labels.  For more information about this discrepancy, see
      the Deep Impact Spacecraft Clock Correlation report,
      SCLK_CORRELATION.ASC, provided on the Deep Impact and EPOXI
      documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
      The EPOXI project plans to generate a complete and highly accurate
      set of UTC correlations since launch.  This will ultimately result
      in a future version of a SCLK that will retroactively change
      correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI data.  When this
      kernel is available, it will be added to the SPICE data sets for
      the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE web site at
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the visible CCDs - the boundary being
      the two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are 1/6 of a pixel
      smaller vertically than a normal row.  Therefore, reconstructed
      images, which have uniform row spacing, have a 1/3-pixel extension
      introduced at the center of the array.  Thus for two features on
      either side of the midpoint line, the vertical component of the
      actual angular separation between those features is one-third of a
      pixel less than their measured difference in vertical pixels in the
      image.  As for all geometric distortions, correction of this
      distortion will require resampling of the image and an attendant
      loss in spatial resolution.  The standard pipeline process does
      not perform this correction so as to preserve the best spatial
      resolution.
 
      The two 1/6-pixel narrower central rows collect only 5/6 of the
      charge of a normal row.  This effect is corrected by the flat-field
      division for calibrated science images so that the pixels in these
      rows have the correct scene radiance assigned to them.  However,
      point-source or disk-integrated photometric measurements using
      aperture photometry areas that include these central rows will be
      slightly distorted unless special adjustments are made.  For
      example, the aperture photometry process for comet 9P/Tempel 1 added
      an extra 1/6-pixel worth of signal to the to the pixels in each of
      these two rows in the reconstructed, calibrated images as described
      in Appendix A of Belton, et al. (2011) [BELTONETAL2011].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the EPOXI:MINIMUM and EPOXI:MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
