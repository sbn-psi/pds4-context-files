    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    This data set contains raw spectra from Total Luminance
    Photometer on the LCROSS spacecraft.  The TLP was active
    only during the final 25 minutes of the mission,
    including the time of the centaur impact.  It sampled an
    ~10 deg full angle, circular field of view at 1000 Hz.
 
    This dataset consists of a single ascii table holding
    temperature-normalized voltages from the instrument and
    a second table holding housekeeping data.  The only
    target was Cabeus crater on the moon.
 
    Note that this dataset is not contain a measurement of
    power.  The Instrument Response and Calibration Report
    describes the detector response as a function of
    wavelength, which, together with an assumption about the
    spectrum observed, is needed to map the measured voltage
    to power.
 
    Related Data Sets
    =================
 
    TLP_RAW_DS holds the raw TLP measurements, in DNs.  This
    dataset is described in TLP_RAW_DS.CAT in this
    directory.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
       Science
       -------
 
       No instrument parameters vary within this dataset.
       The sample rate is uniformly 1000 Hz.
 
       Housekeeping
       ------------
 
       Instrument temperature is reported in the metadata tables in
       the SEM_TEMPERATURE and DEM_TEMPERATURE columns in degrees
       Centigrade.  These are the two spacecraft telemetry points
       closest to the TLP Sensor Electronics Module (SEM) and
       (Digital Electronics Module (DEM) respectively.
 
       TLP_CAL_DS also contains the temperature of the
       detector in degrees Centigrade.  The voltage reported
       in the table has been used to correct the reported
       voltage to a detector temperature of 0 degC.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
    TLP sensor readings were transmitted to the spacecraft
    in 0.1 second groups (100 values).  Each group was
    inserted into telemetry uncompressed and downlinked.
    The ground system extracted these groups in oder and
    appended them to a single .CSV file.  The LCROSS Make
    Archive program read this file, applied temperature
    normalization function, and wrote two PDS-formatted
    table (.TAB) files, one each for the PREIMPACT and
    IMPACT data collection periods.  Corresponding to each
    of these two files is a table (.TAB) file containing
    metadata.
 
    Data
    ====
 
    The data files in this dataset are PDS-formatted, ascii,
    two-column tables with detached label files.  The first
    column contains the time in UTC, and the second column
    contains temperature-normalized voltages.  The rows are
    in time order and generally 1 msec apart.
 
    Metadata is contained in PDS-formatted, ascii,
    multi-column tables, also with detached labels.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    The metadata tables contain the NSP1 boresight vector in
    J2000 Geocentric Inertial frame.  This is the reference
    boresight vector for the LCROSS payload and is
    approximately at the center of the TLP field of view.
 
    Software
    ========
 
    The GSEOS Version used to generate these spectra is GSEOS
    5.2.407 (Feb 25, 2008), Python 2.2.3 (#37, Nov 28, 2003,
    04:20:20), Project Version 6.1.064.
 
    The LCROSS.py Python script used with GSEOS is Version
    Jun 11, 2008.
 
    The LCROSS Report Generator used on GSEOS created
    CCSDS.dat files is version 114.
 
    The version of Satellite Toolkit used to prepare geometric
    information for the labels is 8.1.3.
 
    The LCROSS Make Archive program used to assemble the
    PDS-formatted submission is dated 03/14/2010.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    The confidence level is unspecified.
 
    Review
    ======
 
    This LCROSS data set was reviewed internally by the
    LCROSS science team before delivery to PDS.  This data
    set has passed a PDS peer review.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    LCROSS downlink was oversubscribed at times during the
    preimpact and impact data collection periods, which
    impacted TLP telemetry somewhat.  Here is a summary of
    the percentage of data captured by the instrument that
    was recieved on the ground over several intervals of
    interest:
 
    1. 91% of the data overall (over 23 min, 46.141 sec).
    2. 98% between impact - 1 minute and impact + 1 minute
    3. 100% between impact - 5 sec and impact + 5 sec
 
    That is, there were no telemetry dropouts during the 10
    second interval bracketing the centaur impact.
 
    The TLP suffered an electrical failure in its Sensor
    Electronics Module (SEM) at approximately 11:33:00 UTC,
    roughly 100 seconds after the centaur impact.  The
    behaviou after that time is consisent with a short
    observed during ground testing.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
 
    Other than the quality comments, no limitations are
    noted.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
 
    No data compression was used in the datapath from the
    detector to the formatted files ready for submission to
    the PDS.
