      Data Set Overview
      =================
      Goldstone radar observations of 1620 Geographos from August 28
      through Sept. 2, 1994 yield delay-Doppler images whose linear
      spatial resolutions range from ~75 to ~151 meters, and 138 pairs
      of continuous-wave, dual-polarization (OC/SC) (opposite circular/
      same circular) spectra with one-dimensional resolution of 103 m.
      These data are presented in Ostro, et al. (1996), Icarus 121, 46
      [OSTROETAL1996], and are included in this data set.  A full
      description of the observations and the reduction process is
      provided in the paper.
 
 
      Data
      ====
      Individual images from each successful radar run are in FITS files
      &apos;ge[Nxx].fit&apos; where N is the last digit of DOY (day of year) and
      xx is the run number within that day.  The low-resolution images
      are collected in a collage image &apos;gelrcoll.fit&apos;, and the high-
      resolution images in a collage image &apos;gehrcoll.fit&apos;. Multi-run
      sums of co- registered images from 30 degree blocks of rotational
      phase, for the low- and high-resolution images respectively, are
      in files &apos;gelrsum.fit&apos; and &apos;gehrsum[N].fit&apos; (N=1,3 for the three
      high- resolution summed images).  The collages and summed images
      are the same as the data presented in Figures 8-11 of the paper.
 
      The scaling of the images is explained in the following excerpt
      from the paper:  &apos;Data values for each image in this paper are
      mapped onto a 256-level gray scale.  Since the noise background is
      not interesting, all data values below a clipping level near the
      noise mean are mapped to black to make the most of the gray
      scale&apos;s available dynamic range. Similarly, all data values above
      some saturation level are mapped to white, since the contrast at
      the very highest echo levels contains less interesting information
      than contrast among the more abundant dimmer pixels.&apos;  The levels
      chosen for clipping and saturation level for each image are
      recorded in the label description for that image.
 
      138 individual continuous wave (cw) power spectra are collected in
      the file &apos;gecwall.tab&apos;, and spectra from the bandwidth extrema are
      in &apos;gecwext.tab&apos;. These spectra are the same as those presented in
      Figures 2 and 7 of the paper.
 
 
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      An index of the data with observational circumstances for each run
      is given in the file geindex.tab.
 
 
      Modification History
      ====================
      These data were reviewed internally as part of a general review of
      all Small Bodies Node holdings in April 2002. Minor modifications
      were made to the data labels and documentation files to bring this
      data set up to current SBN standards. The following changes were
      made:
 
        o  Specific times for each image and spectrum file were
           retrieved from Ostro, et al. (1996) and inserted into labels
           and catalog files as appropriate.
 
        o  The AXIS_ORDER_TYPE keyword was added to all image labels to
           reflect the column-major ordering of the FITS images.
 
        o  The TARGET_NAME value was changed from &apos;GEOGRAPHOS&apos; to the
           standard format &apos;1620 GEOGRAPHOS&apos; everywhere it occured.
 
        o  DESCRIPTION fields were added to individual image files to
           indicate whether each image is high or low resolution.
 
        o  Additional description was added to some labels to clarify
           the relationship between the data presented here and the
           corresponding plots and images in Ostro, et al. (1996)
           [OSTROETAL1996].
 
        o  Some file names in the &apos;Data&apos; section above were discovered
           to be in error and were corrected.
 
        o  The object type in the &apos;gecwall&apos; and &apos;gecwext&apos; label files
           was changed from SPECTRUM to TABLE, because the files do not
           meet the strict PDS requirements on the SPECTRUM object.
