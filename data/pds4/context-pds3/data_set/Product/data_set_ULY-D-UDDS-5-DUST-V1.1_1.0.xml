    Version 1.1
    ===========
      This data set, ULY-D-UDDS-5-DUST-V1.1, differs slightly from
      the data set UL-D-UDDS-5-DUST-V1.0 created and reviewed at the
      PDS/Small Bodies Dust Subnode. In addition to the change in
      Data set ID, the following changes have been made:
 
      1) ULYDDUST.TAB - the column &apos;TIME&apos; has been added and the
         missing data flag value for the column &apos;XMASS&apos; has been
         changed from 0 to 9.99e+10.
 
      2) ULYDDUST.LBL - minor changes and updates to reflect changes
         in ULYDDUST.TAB and to provide consistency.
 
    Dataset Overview
    ================
      The data presented with this data set include
 
      1) ULYDDUST.TAB - data received from the dust detector, the
         spacecraft, and physical properties derived from the
         detector data [GRUNETAL1995A].
 
      2) ULYDCODE.TAB - value ranges corresponding to codes found in
         ULYDDUST.TAB.
 
      3) ULYDCALB.TAB - laboratory calibration data used to relate
         instrument responses to physical properties of the
         impacting dust particles.
 
      4) ULYDAREA.TAB - the area of the dust detector exposed to
         particles as a function of their speed direction relative
         to the detector axis.
 
      The data received from the spacecraft are used for determining
      the location and orientation of the spacecraft and instrument.
      Given are the SPACECRAFT SOLAR DISTANCE, ECLIPTIC LONGITUDE,
      ECLIPTIC LATITUDE, SPACECRAFT JUPITER DISTANCE, ROTATION
      ANGLE, DETECTOR ECLIPTIC LONGITUDE, and DETECTOR ECLIPTIC
      LATITUDE.
 
      Data received from the dust detector are given in an integer
      code format. Some of the integer codes represent a range of
      values within which the data could fall (e.g. ION AMPLITUDE
      CODE), some may represent a specific value (e.g. ION COLLECTOR
      THRESHOLD), and others a classification based upon other
      integer codes (e.g. EVENT CLASS).
 
      The instrument data consist of cataloging information,
      instrument status, instrument readings at time of impact, and
      classification information. The cataloging information
      includes the SEQUENCE NUMBER (impact number), TIME (time of
      impact in the format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), JULIAN DATE
      (Julian Date of the time of impact), and SECTOR (the pointing
      of the instrument at time of impact). The instrument status
      data are the threshold levels of the detectors, and the
      CHANNELTRON VOLTAGE LEVEL.
 
      The instrument readings are the amplitude codes of the the
      detectors on-board the instrument, the rise time integer codes
      of the charge level rise times of the detectors, the integer
      code representing the difference in starting times of the ion
      signal and the electron signal, and coincidences between the
      electron and ion signals, and between the ion and channeltron
      signals.
 
      The classification information is used to assist in
      classifying an event into probable impact and non-impact
      categories. There are three variables used in classification:
      EVENT DEFINITION which records which detectors begin a
      measurement cycle, ION AMPLITUDE RANGE which is the
      classification of the ION AMPLITUDE CODE into 6 subranges
      (used with EVENT CLASS) and EVENT CLASS which categorizes
      events into a range of probable impacts to probable
      non-impacts.
 
      The PARTICLE SPEED and PARTICLE MASS and their corresponding
      error factors are determined from the instrument and
      calibration data given in ULYDDUST.TAB and ULYDCALB.TAB,
      respectively.
 
 
    Calibration Data
    ----------------
      ION RISE TIME, ELECTRON RISE TIME, ION CHARGE MASS RATIO, and
      ELECTRON CHARGE MASS RATIO were measured for iron, glass, and
      carbon particles of known mass and impacting at known speeds.
      Since the composition of particles striking the Ulysses
      spacecraft is unknown, logarithmic averages of the above
      values are used to infer the particle speed and mass from the
      instrumental measurements. See [GOLLER1988].
 
 
    Processing Level
    ----------------
      The data contain different levels of processing. Some
      processing is done at the time of the impact observation. This
      processing categorizes the detector responses to transmit the
      data efficiently back to Earth. Data received on Earth is
      given as an integer code. These integer codes can, for
      example, represent ranges of values, or can be a
      classification determined from other integer codes. On Earth,
      these integer codes are then fit to calibration curves to
      determine the speed and mass of the impacting particle. See
      [GOLLER&amp;GRUN1989 and GRUNETAL1995C].
 
      This data set contains the information from the spacecraft
      instrument as received on Earth, information about the
      location and pointing direction of the spacecraft, and the
      meta-data determined from the data analysis.
 
      The calibration data are included as part of this dataset.
 
 
    Sampling Parameters
    -------------------
      The occurence of an impact with the instrument begins a
      measurement cycle. The on-board detectors measure a charge
      accumulation versus time in order to measure the rise time of
      the accumulation and any coincidences between detector
      readings. The on-board computer converts these measurements to
      integer codes to minimize the amount of data that is
      transferred back to Earth. After the conversion, the integer
      codes are categorized to determine if an event is more likely
      to be an impact or noise event. The data are then stored until
      it is time to transmit to Earth.
 
 
    Data Reduction - Impact Speed
    -----------------------------
      Impact speed (V) is obtained from the rise-time measurements
      of the ion and electron detectors (IT and ET, respectively)
      using procedures described in part by GRUNETAL1995C and below
      (see B072295.ASC in the /DOCUMENT/DUST directory of this
      volume). The calibration tables used correspond to the mean
      values obtained for the three different projectile materials
      with which the instruments were calibrated [GOLLER&amp;GRUN1989
      and GRUNETAL1995C]. A rise-time measurement is started when
      the respective signal exceeds its threshold and is stopped by
      a flag pulse from the peak-detector. Impact calibration was
      performed in the speed interval from about 2 km/s to 70 km/s,
      so impact speeds derived from rise-time measurements will be
      limited to this range.
 
      Dust accelerator tests as well as experience with flight data
      have shown that (1) the shape of the ion signal is less
      susceptible to noise than the shape of the electron signal and
      (2) for true impacts, ELECTRON AMPLITUDE CODE values (EA) are
      generally greater than the ION AMPLITUDE CODE values (IA) by 2
      to 6. As a consequence, the electron rise-time is only used
      for impact speed determination if 2 =&lt; EA-IA =&lt; 6. Since both
      speed measurements, if available, are independent, one obtains
      two (often different) values VIT and VET, respectively. The
      impact speed is then taken to be the geometric mean of VIT and
      VET.
 
      Determining VIT:
 
         If IA &gt; 16 and IT &gt; 12, then fix IT=14.
         Else, if IA &gt; 16 and IT =&lt; 12, then add 2 to the
            corresponding value of IT.
         VIT is then found in Table 5b of GRUNETAL1995C or
            ULYDCODE.TAB.
 
         Note: If IT=0, then VIT is invalid and set to -99.9. This
            differs from [GRUNETAL1995C].
 
      Determining VET:
 
         If EA &gt; 16 and ET &gt; 12, then fix ET=14.
         Else, if EA &gt; 16 and ET =&lt; 12, then add 2 to the
            corresponding value of ET.
         VET is then found in Table 5b of GRUNETAL1995C or
            ULYDCODE.TAB.
 
         Note: If ET=0, then VET is invalid and set to -99.9. This
            differs from [GRUNETAL1995C].
 
      If IA=49, or IA&gt;=60, or IA&lt;3, then IT is not valid, and only
      VET is used to determine impact speed.
 
      If EA=15, or EA&gt;=60, or EA&lt;5, then ET is not valid, and only
      VIT is used to determine impact speed.
 
      If IT is invalid and 6&lt;EA-IA or EA-IA&lt;2, then there is no
      valid impact speed.
 
      If neither IT nor ET is valid, then there is no valid impact
      speed.
 
 
    Data Reduction - Impact Speed Error Factor
    ------------------------------------------
      The upper and lower estimates of impactor speed are obtained
      by multiplying and dividing, respectively, the mean particle
      speed by the velocity error factor, VEF. If only one speed is
      measured, and is from the electron detector, the minimum
      uncertainty is VEF=2. If only one speed is measured, and is
      from the ion detector, the minimum uncertainty is VEF=1.9. It
      is assumed that minimum error of 1.6 is achieved if both
      individual speeds agree to within a factor of 4. This error
      corresponds to the logarithmic mean of the minimum errors in
      the two cases when only a single speed is valid.
 
      Since these are all 1-sigma errors, it may happen that VIT or
      VET fall outside the error bar given for the mean impact
      speed, V. In order to avoid this, the error factor is
      &apos;stretched&apos; to contain the values:
 
      If VIT &gt; 4*VET, then
 
          VEF=(VIT/VET-4.)/31.*(1.6*sqrt(35.)-1.6)+1.6
 
      If VET &gt; 4*VIT, then
 
          VEF=(VET/VIT-4.)/31.*(1.6*sqrt(35.)-1.6)+1.6
 
      (see B030696.ASC in the /DOCUMENT/DUST directory of this
      volume).
 
      If the ratio of both speeds exceeds 4, then the uncertainty
      can increase to about 10 in the calibrated speed range. In any
      case, a speed value with an uncertainty factor VEF&gt;6 should be
      ignored.
 
 
    Data Reduction - Impactor Mass
    ------------------------------
      Once a particle&apos;s impact speed (V) has been determined, the
      charge to mass ratio can be determined from calibration
      measurements (Figure 3, GRUNETAL1995C; ULYDCALB.TAB). The
      charge to mass ratio for a given impact speed (V) is
      determined by linear interpolation of the calibration table
      (ULYDCALB.TAB) on a double logarithmic scale, yielding a
      separate value for the ion grid measurement (QIM) and and
      electron grid measurement (QEM).
 
      From these values and the respective impact charges (QI and
      QE) corresponding to IA and EA, respectively (Table 4,
      GRUNETAL1995C; ULYDCALB.TAB), mass values (MQI=QI/QIM and
      MQE=QE/QEM) are determined corresponding to the ion and
      electron grid measurements. When both MQI and MQE are valid,
      the impact particle mass, M, is the geometric mean of these
      two values, or the value corresponding to the valid
      measurement if the other is invalid. If there is no valid
      impact speed, then there is no valid impactor mass.

    Data Reduction - Impactor Mass Error Factor
    -------------------------------------------
      The upper and lower estimate of impactor speed is obtained by
      multiplying and dividing, respectively, the mean particle
      speed by the mass error factor, MEF. If the speed is well
      determined (VEF=1.6) then the mass value can be determined
      with an uncertainty factor MEF=6. Larger speed uncertainties
      can result in mass uncertainty factors greater than 100.
 
      The mass error is calculated from the speed error, keeping in
      mind that mass detection threshold is proportional to speed to
      the 3.5th power. In addition, there is an error factor of 2
      from the amplitude determination. Added together
      (logarithmically) these yield
 
      MEF=10**(sqrt((3.5*log(VEF))**2+(log(2.))**2)
 
      (see B030696.ASC in the /DOCUMENT/DUST directory of this
      volume. This differs from the exponent of 3.4 given in
      GRUNETAL1995A)
 
 
    Coordinate System
    -----------------
      The coordinates of the spacecraft are given in heliocentric
      ecliptic latitude and longitude (Equinox 1950.0), where the
      pointing direction of the sensor is given in spacecraft
      centered ecliptic latitude and longitude (Equinox 1950.0).

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    Impact times
    ------------
      The impact times are recorded with an accuracy of 2 seconds
      [GRUNETAL1995C].
 
 
    Impact speed
    ------------
      The reason for the exclusion of the values IA=49,18 and
      EA=49,31 is empirical. These values are close to the switching
      points of the amplifier ranges and therefore produce incorrect
      time measurements. The adjustment of the times in amplifier
      range 2 was made in order to prevent illegal time values (see
      B072295.ASC in the /DOCUMENT/DUST directory of this volume).
 
 
    Calibration data
    ----------------
      Instrumental values were extrapolated for particle masses and
      speeds outside the range of those tested, and are so marked.
      The accuracy of these numbers is unknown. For an explication
      of the experiments and data used to generate the calibration
      file, see [GOLLER1988].
