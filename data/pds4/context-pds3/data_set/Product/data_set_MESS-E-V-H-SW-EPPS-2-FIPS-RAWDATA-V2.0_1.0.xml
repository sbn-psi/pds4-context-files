            Abstract ======== This data set consists of the MESSENGER
            Energetic Particle and Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) uncalibrated
            observations, also known as EDRs. The system encompasses 2
            instrument subsystems - the Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS)
            and the Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS). EPS covers the
            energy range of 25 to &gt; 500 keV for electrons, and 10
            keV/nucleon to ~3 MeV total energy for ions. FIPS covers the
            energy/ charge range of &lt; 50 eV/q to 20 keV/q. There are nine
            EDR data products, four of science and ancillary data for the EPS
            and the FIPS, and one of engineering and status for the total
            EPPS instrument.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The data set consists of uncalibrated observations, also known as
      EDRs.
 
      For all the EDR products there is a detached PDS label file that
      describes the contents of one data file. Each label file will have
      the same base name as the data file it is describing, with the
      extension .LBL to denote a label file. The label file defines the
      start time and end of the observation, product creation time, and
      the structure of the binary (or ASCII) tables. Each data product
      is identified within the PDS label by a STANDARD_DATA_PRODUCT_ID
      value, shown in parentheses in the table below.
 
      The FIPS portion of the data archive currently consists of four
      EDR data products.  The data collected in one observation is
      downloaded at different times and in different packet formats.
      Therefore, different EDR formats have been developed, each of
      which presents a different grouping of the data. The following
      table shows the different FIPS data products and their files.
      Following is a description of each of the current FIPS EDRs. A
      more complete description of each may be found in the EPPS EDR
      SIS document, located in the DOCUMENT directory of the document
      volume.
 
      Current FIPS Data Products:
 
        High Priority FIPS Spectra (FIPS_HI_SPECTRA)
 
          Spectra Data file contains spectral and velocity
          distribution, hardware and software rate counters in binary
          table format. Data and counter values are taken from the
          High Priority Science Packet Format updated by FSW5 on
          9/6/2007
 
        FIPS Pulse Height (FIPS_PULSE_HEIGHT)
 
          Contains FIPS Pulse Height Analysis data in binary table
          format. As of 8/18/2008 the PHA data product is generated
          from High or Low Priority spectra packets or from FIPS Scan
          packets.  The file naming convention will identify the
          source packet. Format updated by FSW5 on 9/6/2007
 
        FIPS SCAN (FIPS_SCAN)
 
          Contains rate counts sampled at each Deflection System High
          Voltage (DSHV) step in a FIPS scan. New FSW6 EDR.
 
        FIPS High Resolution Proton Velocity Distribution
        (FIPS_HIRES_PROTON_V)
 
          Contains a 32 x 32 high resolution proton velocity distribution,
          integrated over a 10 scan sequence. New FSW6 EDR.
 
      In addition to the science data, associated instrument parameters
      are included.
 
      EPPS Engineering and Status Data Product
 
        The EPPS_LONG_STATUS EDR data product contains the engineering
        and status information for the EPPS instrument. This data product
        consists of an external PDS label file and its pointer to an
        ASCII table file.  The data product is in ASCII to facilitate the
        browsing of instrument status parameters with commonly available
        text readers during mission operations. New FSW5 EDR introduced
        on 9/6/2007
 
 
    Previous Data Set Overview
    ==========================
      On 9/6/2007, version 5 of the EPPS flight software (FSW5) was
      uploaded to the MESSENGER spacecraft. FSW5 implemented several
      changes to the FIPS science telemetry which, in turn, changed the
      format of the FIPS EDRs. One significant change was the removal of
      housekeeping data stored in the FIPS High Priority Science Packet.
      The FIPS_HI_HOUSEKEEPING EDR is no longer generated for data
      collected on or after 9/6/2007.
 
      On 8/18/2008, version 6 of the EPPS flight software (FSW6) was
      uploaded to the MESSENGER spacecraft and installed on the EPPS
      instrument on 8/19/2008. This version introduced two new EDRs, the
      FIPS_SCAN and the FIPS_HIRES_PROTON_V.
 
      Prior to these changes the FIPS portion of the data archive
      consisted of four EDR data products, which corresponded to the
      three priorities of data produced by the FIPS instrument: high,
      medium, and low.  As with the EPS the different priority modes
      result in the data being collected and downloaded in different
      packet formats.  At high and medium priority, these packets contain
      multiple pieces of information, such as a spectral observation and
      housekeeping data. Therefore, different EDR formats have been
      developed, each of which captures one specific data grouping
      spectra, housekeeping information, or PHA data.
 
      Due to these changes the following EDR types have been retired in
      this version of the data set and will no longer be included in
      future archives:
 
        FIPS_HI_HOUSEKEEPING, High Priority FIPS Housekeeping (FSW5,
        9/6/2007)
 
        FIPS_MED_SPECTRA, Medium Priority FIPS Spectra (FSW6, 8/18/2008)
 
      The following EDR types have changed in this version of the
      data set:
 
        FIPS_PULSE_HEIGHT, FIPS Pulse Height (FSW5, 9/6/2007)
 
        FIPS_HI_SPECTRA, High Priority FIPS Spectra (FSW5, 9/6/2007)
 
      The following EDR types are new in this version of the data set:
 
        FIPS_SCAN, FIPS SCAN (FSW6, 8/18/2008)
 
        FIPS_HIRES_PROTON_V, FIPS High Resolution Proton Velocity
        Distribution (FSW6, 8/18/2008)
 
        EPPS_LONG_STATUS, EPPS Engineering and Status (FSW5, 9/6/2007)
 
      These changes are described in detail in the EPPS EDR SIS Document,
      contained in the DOCUMENT directory of the DOC_VOL.
 
 
    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The EPS sensor consists of a 60-mm diameter, tuna-can-like
      cylinder, in which a start foil and stop foil, wrapped around
      opposite curved sides of the cylinder, constitute the TOF chamber.
      The detectors are arranged so that each detector senses the
      events within a given range of incidence angles.  Each of the 6
      detector modules is composed of 4 pixels: large and small ion and
      large and small electron.  The FIPS consists of an electrostatic
      analyzer (ESA), located at the entrance to the sensor, a
      post-acceleration chamber between the output of the ESA and the
      carbon foil, and a time-of-flight telescope.  The ESA at the
      entrance to the FIPS acts as a wide-angle lens for ions.  It only
      allows ions with a specific energy/charge band to enter through
      its output plane.
 
      See the EPPSINST.CAT file for more information and
      [ANDREWSETAL2007] for full details.
 
 
    Calibration Overview
    ====================
      This data set is NOT calibrated; it only provides the uncalibrated
      sensor measurements.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The principal parameters during normal science operations when
      observing with the EPPS are as follows:
 
      * EPS Medium-Priority Integration Interval (N2): This parameter
      sets the integration interval for medium-priority data (commonly
      30 s).
 
      * EPS High-Priority Integration Interval (N1): This parameter sets
      the integration interval for high-priority data (commonly 300 s).
      N1 is an integer-multiple of N2.
 
      * EPS Detector Selection: EPS possesses 24 detectors: 12 for ions
      and 12 for electrons.  Half are large-pixel, and half are
      small-pixel.  Only 12 detectors can be used simultaneously, so the
      operational detectors can be set by command.
 
      * FIPS Mode Selection: This command allows selection of the mode
      of operation: normal, burst, and pick-up ion.
 
      The EPPS also includes modes for testing the instrument and
      maintenance activities.

   Confidence Level Overview
   =========================
     The EPPS EDR data are the least processed data set released for the
     EPPS.  Data presented here are an accurate representation of the EPPS
     data as received from the spacecraft, with minimal timing and no
     spatial processing.
 
 
   Review
   ======
     The EPPS EDR was reviewed internally by the EPPS team prior to
     release to the PDS. PDS also performed an external review of the
     EPPS EDR.

     No EPPS data were collected during Venus_1_Flyby phases.  The EPPS
     was on for brief periods during the other six mission phases.
     During these planned operational periods, the EPS sensor on the EPPS
     did not have high voltage enable, hence no Time-of-flight data and
     only spectra data were collected.  The EPS was turned on for the
     Venus_2_Flyby and to be remained on throughout the remainder of the
     mission phases.  EPPS data were collected during the Mercury_1_Flyby.
 
     EPS High Ion Sector 1 and 5 have malfunction detectors and do not
     produce any data product.
 
     The lowest energy channel (32 to 55 keV) on the High Ion Sector 3
     and 5 have periodic high count that are due to flight software
     interaction with the instrument and should not be used.  User of
     EPS data should consult with the instrument team at JHU/APL to
     verify the quality of specific data in certain time interval prior
     to publication.
 
     On 18 Aug 2008 (231), a new Flight Software (FSW) was uploaded to EPPS.
     This new FSW (v6) enhances the energy resolution for EPS and adds a
     high- resolution proton distribution data packet on FIPS. Description of
     these new data products are included in the FMT file.  In addition, the
     new FSW v6 fixed the data spikes in the EPS data (as mentioned in the
     previous paragraph). As always, user of the EPS data should consult with
     the instrument team at JHU/APL to verify the quality of specific data
     prior to publicaion.
 
     On 18 August 2009 (230), another new FSW was uploaded to EPPS.  This new
     FSW (v7) only affects the FIPS data.
 
     In the nominal flight configuration, the FIPS sensor on the EPPS
     field-of-view will not measure the solar wind.  Periodically, the
     spacecraft was rotated such that the FIPS field-of-view can detect
     the nominal radial flowing solar wind.  These periods typically lasted
     less than 3 hours and are identified as:
 
                        Start time         End time
     Phase Name         Date (DOY)         Date (DOY)

     A dark count signature was discovered in the FIPS PHA data.
     These counts appear in a time-of-flight -- E/q histogram of PHA
     data as straight tracks in E/q, centered at about 8 different
     time-of-flights.  These dark counts significantly complicate the
     analysis of FIPS PHA data, though not significantly for low mass
     ions (H+, He+ and He2+).  All data since launch is affected.
     This situation has been well characterized by the FIPS team and
     models/algorithms for removing these counts have been developed.
     These algorithms are currently being refined and will be published
     and included in PDS documentation soon.
 
     A small bug was found in FSW v7 which causes only the high order
     4 bits of the wedge, strip and zigzag values are transmitted in
     the data.  This has the effect of reducing the position
     resolution for heavy ions in the FSW v7 data.  A software patch
     has been created and is expected to be implemented by the end of
     2009.
 
     Most of the Mercury_4_cruise phase was spent running flight tests in
     support of the dark counts investigation.  As such, this data is not
     useful for scientific studies.  There are two periods which are
     exceptions, but the instrument was run in somewhat different voltage
     configurations during those periods, so care should be taken during
     data analysis:
 
                        Start              End               MCPHV  PAHV
     Phase Name         Date (DOY)         Date (DOY)        (V)    (kV)
     ----------------- ----------------   ----------------   -----  ---------
     Mercury 4 cruise  09 Jul 2010 (190)  29 Jul 2010 (210)  -2500  -10.5
     Mercury 4 cruise  01 Nov 2010 (305)  31 Nov 2010 (335)  -2520   -9.5
 
     In orbit, FIPS is regularly taken out of nominal configuration for
     various spacecraft operations, such as commanded momentum dumps and
     eclipses, typically prevent possible high voltage discharge within FIPS
     or for power considerations. On occasion, the EPPS flight software
     autonomously takes FIPS out of nominal configuration in response to an
     anomaly.  These intervals can be identified in the EPPS_LONG_STATUS data
     as periods where the MCPHV and PAHV levels are different from the
     nominal.
 
     FIPS regularly experiences penetrating radiation which serves as an
     additional noise source in the start and stop single-coincidence rates.
     These counts are identified in start and stop rate spectra as relatively
     constant streaks across the energy spectrum, because they bypass the
     electrostatic analyzer energy selction when they pass through the FIPS
     solid structures to trigger the detectors.  Typically, these signals do
     not occur in double-coincidence and therefore do not affect the science
     data.  (That is, they do not generate PHA events or add to the valid
     event or proton rate.) When double-coincidences do occur, they are often
     so short in duration (&lt; 1 min) that they can be ignored in all but the
     most fine time scale analysis. Occasionally, events occur that are of
     sufficient intensity and duration as to make the double coincidence data
     unusable, such as long duration solar energetic particle (SEP) events.
     These events should be excluded from science analysis and marked as
     &apos;bad&apos; in the data quality flag.  For convenience, they are listed in the
     table below.

     As of PDS release 10, SEPs (above) are marked in the quality flag of the
     CDR data. Users are encouraged to use CDR data if they want to be able to
     automatically filter out SEPs and other events.  For consistency, the
     above table will no longer be updated.
