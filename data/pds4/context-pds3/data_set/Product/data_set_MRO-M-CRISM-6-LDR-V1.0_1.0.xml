    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This volume contains portions of the CRISM Limb Data Record
      (LDR) Archive, a collection of multiband images from the Compact
      Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars on the Mars
      Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.  Images consist of
      information on observation conditions of IR and VNIR data
      cubes pointed at Mars&apos; limb, mapped to the sensor space of
      non-map-projected data. The data are stored with PDS labels.
 
      This volume also contains an index file (&apos;imgindx.tab&apos;) that
      tabulates the contents of the volume, ancillary data files, and
      documentation files.
 
      For more information on the contents and organization of the
      volume set refer to the aareadme.txt file located in the root
      directory of the data volumes.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
      CRISM observing scenarios are constructed using a set of key
      variables (&apos;configurations&apos;) which include the following. All
      are selectable separately for the VNIR and IR detectors. Only a
      subset of the configurations represent &apos;scene&apos; data, as
      indicated by the EDR keyword MRO:ACTIVITY_ID. Only scene data that
      are aimed at Mars&apos; limb have corresponding LDRs. Only those
      configurations that affect an LDR are discussed below:
 
      Image source: Image data may be generated using digitized output
      from the detector, or using one of up to seven test patterns.
      Only data from the detector may have a corresponding LDR.
 
      Pixel binning: Pixels can be saved unbinned or binned 2x, 5x, or
      10x in the spatial direction. No pixel binning in the spectral
      direction is supported. Data with any pixel binning
      configuration may have a corresponding LDR, but the nominal
      binning configuration for limb-pointed observations is 10x.
 
      Calibration lamps: 4095 levels are commandable in each of two
      lamps at each focal plane, and in two lamps in the integrating
      sphere. All lamps can be commanded open-loop, meaning that
      current is commanded directly.  For the integrating sphere only,
      closed loop control is available at 4095 settings. For closed
      loop control, the setting refers to output from a photodiode
      viewing the interior of the integrating sphere; current is
      adjusted dynamically to attain the commanded photodiode output.
      Note: lamps reach maximum current at open- or closed-loop
      settings &lt;4095. Only data for which the calibration lamps are
      off may have an accompanying LDR.
 
      Shutter position:  Open, closed, or viewing the integrating
      sphere. The shutter is actually commandable directly to position 0
      through 32.  In software, open=3, sphere=17, closed=32. NOTE:
      during integration and testing, it was discovered that at
      positions &lt;3 the hinge end of the shutter is directly illuminated
      and creates scattered light. Position 3 does not cause this
      effect, but the other end of the shutter slightly vignettes
      incoming light. Only data in which the shutter is open, and at
      position 3, may have an accompanying LDR.
 
      Pointing:  CRISM has two basic gimbal pointing configurations and
      two basic superimposed scan patterns.  Pointing can be (1) fixed
      (nadir-pointed in the primary science orbit) or (2) dynamic,
      tracking a target point relative to the surface of Mars and taking out
      ground track motion. A limb observation tracks a point near Mars&apos;
      limb along the projection of the groundtrack, and superimposes a
      scan relative to that point.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The CRISM data stream downlinked by the spacecraft unpacks into a
      succession of compressed image frames with binary headers
      containing housekeeping. In each image, one direction is spatial
      and one is spectral.  There is one image for the VNIR focal plane
      and one image for the IR focal plane. The image from each focal
      plane has a header with 220 housekeeping items that contain full
      status of the instrument hardware, including data configuration,
      lamp and shutter status, gimbal position, a time stamp, and the
      target ID and macro within which the frame of data was taken. These
      parameters are stored as part of an Experiment Data Record (EDR),
      which consists of raw data, or a Targeted Reduced Data Record, or
      TRDR, the &apos;calibrated&apos; equivalent of an EDR.
 
      The data in one EDR or TRDR represent a series of image frames
      acquired with a consistent instrument configuration (shutter
      position, frame rate, pixel binning, compression, exposure time,
      on/off status and setting of different lamps). Each frame has
      dimensions of detector columns (spatial samples) and detector
      rows (wavelengths, or bands). The multiple image frames are
      concatenated, and are formatted into a single multiple-band
      image (suffix *.IMG) in one file, plus a detached list file in
      which each record has housekeeping information specific to one
      frame of the multiple-band image (suffix *.TAB). The multiple-
      band image has dimensions of sample, line, and wavelength. The
      size of the multiple-band image varies according to the
      observation mode but is deterministic given the macro ID. A
      typical multiple-band image might have XX pixels in the sample
      (cross-track) dimension, YY pixels in the line (along-track)
      dimension, and ZZ pixels in the wavelength dimension, where:
 
      XX (samples) = 640/binning, where 640 is the number of columns
      read off the detector, and binning is 1, 2, 5, or 10;
 
      YY (lines) = the number of image frames with a consistent
      instrument configuration; and
 
      ZZ (bands) = the number of detector rows (wavelengths) whose
      read-out values are retained by the instrument.
 
      Once image data are assembled into EDRs and calibrated into TRDRs,
      DDRs are created for data pointed at the surface, and LDRs are
      created for data pointed at the limb. For DDRs version 0 represents
      values based on predicted pointing, and version 1 is based on
      actual, reconstructed pointing. For LDRs both version 0 and 1 are
      used but both are based on reconstructed pointing.
 
      Each of the planes of an LDR represents some value evaluated at or
      above the surface intercept of Mars shape model, or at or above
      the intercept with a surface parallel to the areoid. The following
      items, some represented in SPICE files or &apos;kernels,&apos; affect the
      properties encoded in an LDR:
 
      Position of Mars: This is encoded in the planetary ephemeris
      kernel.
 
      Position of MRO: This is encoded in the spacecraft ephemeris
      kernel.
 
      Orientation of MRO: This is encoded in the spacecraft C kernel.
 
      Orientation of CRISM&apos;s gimbal in the MRO reference frame: This
      is encoded in the CRISM part of the MRO frames kernel.
 
      Orientation of CRISM&apos;s VNIR and IR fields of view relative to
      the gimbal. This also is encoded in the CRISM part of the MRO
      frames kernel.
 
      Position of CRISM&apos;s gimbal within its plane: This is encoded in
      a CRISM C kernel. CRISM&apos;s C kernel is derived from gimbal
      positions at the beginning, middle, and end of the integration
      of each line of an EDR or TRDR images file, which is given in
      the table of instrument housekeeping that accompanies every EDR
      and TRDR.
 
      Position of each spatial pixel in a CRISM image relative to the
      center of the field of view: This is encoded in the instrument
      kernel.
 
      Mars shape model and areoid: The shape model and areoid used to
      construct DDRs and LDRs is from the Mars Orbiter Laser altimeter,
      or MOLA, gridded at 128 pixels per degree [SMITHETAL1999].
 
      CRISM has optical distortions such that each wavelength, or
      band, has a very slightly different surface projection onto
      Mars. Each band corresponds to a row on the VNIR or IR detector.
      To avoid ambiguity, a DDR or LDR represents the information
      corresponding to a reference detector row near 610 nm (row
      number 223) for the VNIR, or near 2300 nm (row number 257) for
      the IR. The relationship between different bands is included in
      the instrument kernel.
 
      The sequence of processing that creates a DDR or LDR is as follows.
      EDRs are assembled from raw data. TRDRs are created from the
      EDRs and Calibration Data Records, or CDRs, using a calibration
      algorithm discussed at length in an Appendix in the CRISM Data
      Products SIS. Gimbal positions are extracted from the EDR
      housekeeping and formatted as a gimbal C kernel. Using that and
      other SPICE kernels discussed above, intercepts on the MOLA
      shape model or at a tangent height above it, and intercepts at a
      tangent height above the areoid are calculated for each spatial
      pixel (sample at the reference detector row).
 
      The derived image bands include the following:
 
      1. Latitude. Defined in one of two ways:
       (a) If the instrument boresight does not intercept the Martian
       areoid: Evaluated at the tangent point of the limb observation;
       the intercept with the areoid of a vector originating at the
       center of the planet, that is normal to the instrument boresight.
       (b) If the instrument boresight does intercept the Martian
       areoid: same definition as in the DDR. Evaluated at the intercept
       of the instrument boresight with the MOLA shape model.

    Data
    ====
 
      There is only one data type associated with this volume, the
      Limb Data Records or LDRs. There are 15 layers in each LDR,

    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      Ancillary data are provided with this dataset:
 
      1. SPICE kernels, used to contruct observational geometry, are
      available in the GEOMETRY directory. See GEOMINFO.TXT for more
      details.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      The cartographic coordinate system used for the CRISM data
      products conforms to the IAU planetocentric system with East
      longitudes being positive. The IAU2000 reference system for Mars
      cartographic coordinates and rotational elements was used for
      computing latitude and longitude coordinates.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      The CRISM archive will be made available online via Web and FTP
      servers.  This will be the primary means of distribution.
      Therefore the archive will be organized as a set of virtual
      volumes, with each data set stored online as a single volume. As
      new data products are released they will be added to the volume&apos;s
      data directory, and the volume&apos;s index table will be updated
      accordingly. The size of the volume will not be limited by the
      capacity of the physical media on which it is stored; hence the
      term virtual volume.  When it is necessary to transfer all or part
      of a data set to other media such as DVD for distribution or for
      offline storage, the virtual volume&apos;s contents will be written to
      the other media according to PDS policy, possibly dividing the
      contents among several physical volumes.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The major sources of uncertainty in LDRs arise from uncertainties
      in instrument pointing knowledge, and from coverage of the MOLA data
      set.
 
      The formal pointing uncertainty for the CRISM gimbal plane is 1
      mrad each in the spacecraft yaw(z), roll(x), or pitch/gimbal(y)
      axes. The formal uncertainty in reconstructed spacecraft
      attitude is similar. Uncertainty in CRISM&apos;s gimbal attitude is
      negligible, about 0.006 mrad. The formal error in projection
      onto a surface location depends on the angle of the
      gimbal and typically is of order several hundreds of meters.
      Experience during operations suggests that the actual errors
      are smaller than expected formal errors, so that typical error
      in surface location is about 200 meters.
 
      Latitude and longitude are described by the intersection of
      CRISM field of view with the MOLA shape model. Given the
      uncertainties in location of a point on the surface, expected
      uncertainty near the equator is of the order of 0.005 degrees.
      Uncertainties in incidence, emission, and phase angles relative
      to the areoid are similar.
 
      Errors in incidence and emission angle relative to the MOLA
      shape model are dominated by the lower sampling density of the
      shape model. MOLA points are typically a few hundred meters
      apart. This compares to CRISM&apos;s sampling scale of 15 to 200
      meters per spatial pixel, depending on instrument configuration.
      In areas of smooth topography the errors are small, but in areas
      with topography that is rough at scales less than a few hundred
      meters, uncertainty is several degrees. The same uncertainties
      apply to slope magnitude.
 
      LDR Versions
      ============
 
      Changes in the processing of LDRs are denoted by incrementing the
      software version. There is no difference between versions 0 and 1.
 
      Known Issue with LDR Accuracy
      =============================
 
      None.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set will be examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The
      peer review will be conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      For each observation, every EDR is compared against frame-by-frame
      predictions of commanded instrument state. The results of the
      comparison are written as a data validation report that
      accompanies the EDRs for that observation.
 
      In the case of a hardware or configuration discrepancy (shutter
      position, lamp status or level, pixel binning, frame rate, channel
      selection, power status of detectors), processing of the image
      data to RDR level does not occur in order to avoid introducing
      invalid results, and LDRs are not created. Also, missing frames or
      portions of frames are replaced with a value of 65535 (this cannot
      be a valid data value). That portion of the EDR is not further
      processed, and it also is propagated to a value of 65535 in all
      layers of the LDR.
 
      Only a subset of instrument configurations represent &apos;scene&apos; data,
      as indicated by the keyword MRO:ACTIVITY_ID. Only scene data
      aimed at Mars&apos; limb have corresponding LDRs.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
