    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Mini-RF Calibrated Data Archive is a time-ordered
      collection of calibrated Level 1 SAR images collected by the
      Mini-RF instrument during the LRO mission to the Moon.
      They also contain stokes parameters files, polarization ratio
      files, and a browse image.
 
      Please see documentation in the DOCUMENT directory for
      additional information on the data files and their format.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      See individual SIS documents, which are located in the
      DOCUMENT directory, for detailed descriptions of each file
      contained in this data archive.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      The POC produces Level 1 SAR CDRs by ingesting the Level 0 EDRs and
      associated Level 0 ancillary files into the SAR processor (Level 0
      data are intermediate products generated from raw (PDR) products.
      Level 0 data are not archived in PDS.).  Calibration is applied.
      A full PDS label accompanies each data file and gives
      a detailed description of the content and format.
 
    Data
    ====
      The Level 1 CDRs are SAR images in range and azimuth orientation
      with pixel values in beta naught, which have been radiometrically
      and polarmetrically calibrated. Each cross-product image file
      contains simple lines of pixels.  Each pixel consists of four 4-byte
      floating point numbers for a total of 16 bytes.  The first two
      floating point numbers are the image intensity values for the
      horizontal (H) and vertical (V) channel receive.  The second two
      numbers are the real and imaginary parts of the single complex number
      which gives the cross power intensity image between the H &amp; V receive.
      H &amp; V represent the complex amplitudes of the horizontal and vertically
      polarized backscatter respectively. An &apos;*&apos; represents a complex
      conjugate of H or V.  The Level 1 products are the lowest level usable
      science data products.
 
      These data are stored in the DATA/SAR/&lt;orbit&gt;/LEVEL1 directory on
      archival volumes. File names are described in MRFLRO_DP_SIS.PDF.
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Each science product is accompanied by a text metadata file
      that contains the parameters that describe the state the instrument
      was in at the time of data collection and location and timing
      information about the data set.  This file is referenced in the
      PDS label associated with the science data product.
 
    Calibration Data
    ================
      Calibration files produced by the Vexcel(TM) CalPro processor are
      included with the Level 1 data set.  Consult the Mini-RF Calibration
      Plan included in the DOCUMENT directory of this archive and the
      MRF_INST.CAT file for details.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Level 1 data products are not dependent on definition of a
      coordinate system.
 
    Software
    ========
      No software is included with this archival data set.
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      These products are delivered on a hard-drive or by ftp and
      not on a specific formatted medium.
        </data_set_desc>

Overview
========
The Level 1 Mini-RF CDR data are the least processed data set released for
the Mini-RF instrument.  Data presented here are an accurate representation
of the Mini-RF data as received from the spacecraft, with no Doppler or
spatial processing.
 
 
Review
======
The Mini-RF EDR was reviewed internally by the Mini-RF team prior to release
to the PDS.  PDS also performed an external review of the Mini-RF EDR.
 
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
Data reported are the minimally processed data received from the spacecraft
during five mission phases: Launch, Cruise, Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition,
Commissioning, and Exploration_Mission.  These mission phases are defined as:
 
    Start time               End time
    Phase Name               Date (DOY)               Date (DOY)
    -----------------        ----------------         ----------------
    LAUNCH                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        18 Jun 2009 (169)
    CRUISE                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    LUNAR ORBIT ACQUISITION  23 Jun 2009 (174)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    COMMISSIONING            23 Jun 2009 (174)        14 Sep 2009 (257)
    NOMINAL MISSION          15 Sep 2009 (258)        14 Sep 2010 (257)
    SCIENCE MISSION          15 Sep 2010 (258)        14 Sep 2012 (258)
 
No Mini-RF data were collected during Launch, Cruise, or
Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition phases. The Mini-RF collected data during each of
the other two mission phases. During these planned operational periods, the
Mini-RF functioned nominally and the data quality was good.
 
A S-Band receive calibration test was conducted on 20 August, 2009.  S-Band
transmit calibration tests were conducted on 22-23 August, 2009.  These
calibrations permit the characterization of both transmit polarization purity
as well as determining how precisely polarization can be measured by the
instrument.
 
Communications demonstration.  Mini-RF experiments to demonstrate half-duplex
communications were conducted on 16 August and 20 August, 2009.
 
The Mini-RF began collecting data over the lunar south polar region 13 July
2009 to support LCROSS targeting by characterizing the surfaces of
permanently shadowed regions.  This data collection phase continued until the
LCROSS impact on 9 October. 2009.
 
From Oct 14 through Dec. 17, Mini-RF was largely restricted to collecting
data over non-polar sites that lie equatorward of 63 degrees latitude North
and South.
 
Since 26 December 2010, the Mini-RF instrument has not transmitted the RF
energy required to create radar images of the lunar surface. The Mini-RF team
looked at the initial 13 collects attempted from that date forward and noted
that in all but one collect the data appeared bad, looking like noise.  The
team continued to attempt data collections at a reduced rate (about 1 collect
per day) through January 23, 2011. Products included in this data set made
from data collected after 26 December 2010 do not contain scientifically
usefull data.
 
Limitations
===========
This data set is minimally processed data.  The data are received from the
spacecraft telemetry, ingested into the LRO Missions Operations Center (MOC),
and then transferred to the APL Payload Operations Center (POC).
