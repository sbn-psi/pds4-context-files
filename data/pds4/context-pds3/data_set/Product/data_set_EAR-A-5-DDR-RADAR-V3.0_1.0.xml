            This dataset is intended to include all groundbased asteroid
            radar detections. These data were collected from the published
            literature by Dr. Steven J. Ostro. Observations which have not
            yet been published, or which have been reported only in an
            abstract, are included in the dataset as an entry with blank data
            fields, for the purpose of informing the dataset users of the
            existence of these detections. As the data from these detections
            are published, the data are added to this dataset in yearly
            updates.

Data Set Overview
=================
This dataset is intended to include all groundbased asteroid radar
detections.  These data were collected from the published literature
by Dr.  Steven J. Ostro.  Observations which have not yet been
published, or which have been reported only in an abstract, are
included in the dataset as an entry with blank data fields, for the
purpose of informing the dataset users of the existence of these
detections.  As the data from these detections are published, the
data are added to this dataset in yearly updates.  Scientific
questions about this dataset should be directed to Dr. Steven J.
Ostro, JPL, at the email address ostro@echo.jpl.nasa.gov.
 DATA_PROVIDER_FULL_NAME        = &apos;Steven J. Ostro&apos;
 
 
Modification History
====================
The radar data set was first introduced into PDS at the April 1994
asteroid datasets review, and has been updated yearly since that
time.  Updates consist in adding entries for asteroid radar
detections made since the previous update, and adding full data for
detections which have been published since the last update.
 DATA_SET_UPDATE_PERIOD         = 1.0
 
 
Parameters
==========
An entry for each detection reports radar cross-section and circular
polarization, if known, error values for these parameters, the year
of observation, and the reference in which the observations were
reported.
 
 
Processing
==========
No processing has been performed on these data beyond that reported
in the published papers from which the data were drawn.
 
 
Data
====
This dataset comprises a single data table, &apos;radar.tab&apos;, tabulating
the parameters listed above.
 
 
Media/Format
============
This dataset is released as an ascii file which may be stored on disk
or other magnetic medium and which may be distributed by ftp, email,
real-time access by remote login, or whatever means is most
convenient.

Confidence Level Overview
=========================
The confidence level of each data value reported is reflected in the
uncertainty value in the same entry.  Further information about the
observations can be obtained by consulting the original reference for
each entry.
 
 
Review
======
This data set underwent formal external review on March 29, 1995.
 
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
This dataset is intended to include all groundbased radar detections
of asteroids.  It is complete through January 1996.
 
 
Limitations
===========
This dataset is intended only to collect the data reported in the
published literature, as well as to record the existence of
unpublished asteroid radar detections.
