  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains calibrated, 1.05- to 4.8-micron spectral images
    of the Moon acquired the High Resolution Infrared Spectrometer (HRII)
    from 29 December 2007 through 18 December 2009 during several
    in-flight instrument calibrations for the EPOXI mission.  These
    data were used by Sunshine, et al. (2009) [SUNSHINEETAL2009] in
    &apos;Temporal and Spatial Variability of Lunar Hydration As Observed
    by the Deep Impact Spacecraft&apos;.
 
    The following list summarizes the lunar calibrations in this dataset.
    Each exposure ID represents one set of spectral images that were
    taken as the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft scanned across the lunar
    disk.  Descriptive text for each activity is included below.

    Lunar Calibration:  On 29 December 2007 as the spacecraft approached
      Earth, the three science instruments used the Moon as a target to
      acquire data for recalibration purposes.  The sequence included
      along- and cross-slit HRII scans of the moon for flat fields and
      characterization of the HRII anti-saturation filter.  (Please note
      the flat-field data were mostly saturated at long wavelengths).
      Due to a minor error in the lunar calibration sequence, a series of
      HRII dark frames were not recorded.  A retest to acquire the missing
      HRII darks was scheduled for 16-17 January 2008.
 
    HRII Lunar Flats and Radiometry:  On 1-2 June 2009, the HRII
      spectrometer acquired a series of east/west scans of the moon along
      the IR slit for flats.  These data were the best obtained to date
      for the purpose of generating flat fields for the IR spectrometer.
      Also three cross-slit north/south scans of the moon were acquired
      for lunar radiometry.  Please note these data have poor
      signal-to-noise at short wavelengths.
 
    HRII Lunar Antisat Filter and Radiometry:  On 9 June 2009, the HRII
      spectrometer imaged the moon using cross-slit north/south scans to
      better characterize the effects of the anti-saturation filter in the
      IR spectra.  These data were also used for radiometry.
 
    HRII Lunar Flats/Radiometric Cal #1 and #2:  On 05 and 12 December
      2009 as the spacecraft approached Earth, the IR spectrometer made
      north/south cross-slit scans of the moon for radiometry and
      east/west scans along the slit for lunar flats and a radiometric
      calibration.  Please note the flat-field data are very good.
 
    HRII Lunar South Pole Radiometry:  On 18 December 2009, about 10 days
      before the distant flyby of Earth the IR spectrometer made
      north/south cross-slit scans of the lunar south pole for radiometric
      analysis.

  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial/along-slit) FITS
    spectral images and PDS labels in this dataset were generated by the
    Deep Impact/EPOXI calibration pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s
    Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  The final version of
    the pipeline for HRII processing, dated January 2013, was used.  Known
    limitations and deficiencies of the pipeline and the resulting data are
    discussed in the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document in this
    dataset and by Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
    For HRII spectra, the pipeline generates two types of calibrated
    products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be reversible
        because the calibration steps can be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be irreversible because
        the calibration steps, such as smoothing over bad pixels, cannot
        easily be backed out to return to the original, raw data
        numbers.
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes, in the
    order listed, on the raw HRII FITS data to produce the RADREV and
    RAD products found in this data set (the process uses the image
    mode to select the appropriate set of calibration files):
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS header
      - Per-pixel linearization of raw data numbers
      - Subtraction of dark noise, derived using pixel-by-pixel
        linearization of either optimized mode-dependent master dark
        frames (the prisms/spectral imaging module and IR focal plane
        array temperatures, OPTBENT and IRFPAT in the FITS header, are
        used for scaling because dark modeling is required for these data)
      - Division by a flat field, derived from pixel-by-pixel linearization
      - Determine spectral registration and bandwidth for each pixel
        (using OPTBENT from FITS headers)
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV) and that was
        derived from pixel-by-pixel linearization
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust.
      - Set non-image pixels at the left, right, and bottom edges to zero in
        the RADREV and RAD products.  The &apos;real data&apos; window of an image
        is given by CALWINDW in the FITS header.  If edge pixels need to be
        analyzed, the original DN values can be found in the raw products
        located in the PDS dataset, DIF-CAL-HRII-2-EPOXI-CALIBRATIONS-V2.0.
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the per-pixel
    image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps derived for per-pixel linearity (missing pixels were
        identified when the raw FITS files were created).
 
    The pipeline also created FITS image extensions for a spectral
    registration (wavelength) map, a spectral resolution (bandwidth) map,
    and a signal-to-noise ratio map, which are briefly described in the
    next section.  The calibration steps and files applied to each raw
    image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS
    data label.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated spectral image is stored as FITS.  The primary
      data unit contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the
      fastest varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from
      about 1.05 to 4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding
      to the spatial or along-slit dimension.  The primary image is
      followed by four image extensions that are two-dimensional
      pixel-by-pixel maps providing additional information about the
      spectral image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte consisting of eight,
          single-bit flags to describe the quality of each pixel
          in the primary image.  The PDS data label defines the
          purpose of each single-bit flag.
 
        - The second extension provides the spectral registration or
          wavelength for each pixel in the primary image.  This
          extension is required because the wavelength for each
          pixel changes as the temperature of the instrument
          increased or decreased.
 
        - The third extension provides the spectral bandwidth for
          each pixel in the primary image.  This extension is
          required because the bandwidth for each pixel changes as
          the temperature of the instrument increased or decreased.
 
        - The fourth extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a data label and provides more information about the FITS primary
      image and the extensions.  Many values in a data label were
      extracted from FITS image header keywords which are defined in the
      document EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for calibrated data labels and FITS files is
      HIyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;HI&apos; identifies the HRII
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images can be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Spectral scans often had 8 or more frames for one specific exposure.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      frame number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in
      the data labels.  For example, if 8 frames were commanded for a scan
      with an exposure ID of 1000005, the first FITS file name would be
      HI07122918_1000005_001_RR_FIT and the last would be
      HI07122918_1000005_008_RR_FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All data products in this dataset are uncompressed.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when it is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Spectral Scans
    --------------
      Each HRII scan of the Moon consists of multiple frames within one
      exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in the data labels).  To work with these
      spectral scans, it is recommended that all frames for one exposure
      ID be stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a
      spatial-spatial map can be produced for a specific wavelength by
      selecting the appropriate spectral column from the image cube.
      Spectral wavelengths are provided by the second FITS extension, the
      spectral registration (wavelength) map.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      There are no visible CCD context images provided in this dataset
      to aid in orienting the IR slit location with the Moon during
      a particular observation, although context images are available
      in the raw MRI in-flight calibration image dataset,
      DIF-CAL-MRI-2-EPOXI-CALIBRATIONS-V2.0.
 
      Utilizing the infrared data scans themselves is currently the best
      way to determine the slit location on the Moon.  The user can create
      a three-dimensional cube as described above then use the ~2.4-micron
      spatial-spatial map to determine where the slit was pointed during
      that particular scan. Geometry values, such as right ascension and
      declination, given in the data labels are for the instrument
      boresight and do not easily give positional information along the
      slit for tying a pixel to a specific point on the Moon.
 
 
    Timing for Spectra
    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction is
      vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out from the
      left and right edges and toward the center and starting with the
      first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at the top of
      the display.  Since the detector is reset and read out on a
      pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at which
      each pixel is exposed although each pixel has the same exposure
      duration -- except for the ALTFF mode that has different read and
      reset causing the effective exposure time to vary with line number,
      i.e., along the slit in the spatial direction.  Additionally, the end
      of the spectrometer slit that always points roughly towards the sun
      is the first line to be readout and the last line to be read out is
      furthest from the sun, assuming the spacecraft is in its usual
      orientation with the solar panels pointing roughly toward the sun.
      For more information about the timing of the spectra, see the zero
      exposure background section of the EPOXI instrument calibration paper
      by Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].  A brief discussion
      about how the calibration pipeline handles the ALTFF mode is included
      in the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      The calibrated RADREV and RAD image data have units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      A summary of the imaging modes is provided here. For more information
      see Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005], Klaasen, et al. (2008)
      [KLAASENETAL2006] and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].  In
      the table below, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is the
      spatial dimension along the slit.
 
                    X-Size  Y-Size  Bin
        Mode Name   (pix)   (pix)  Type  Comments
        ---- ------ ------  -----  ----- ------------------------------------
          1  BINFF    512     256   2x2  Binned full frame
          2  BINSF1   512     126   2x2  Binned sub-frame

                                         by a separate read frame such that
                                         odd IMAGE_NUMBERs are reset frames
                                         and even IMAGE_NUMBERs are read
                                         frames
          7  MEMCK   1024     512   1x1  Memory Check
 
      Subframe modes are binned (2x2), reduce the spatial (LINE) extent of
      the image FOV, and have a shorter readout time which reduces the
      exposure time for bright objects and keeps the detector from
      saturating.
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For lunar observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  The kernels are archived in the
    EPOXI SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Interference Pattern
    --------------------
      Some of the lunar scans (e.g. exposure ID 1000000) show an
      interference pattern that is most obvious at short wavelengths.
      This pattern is produced by the beamsplitter, which is discussed in
      Klaassen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].  As noted there, the
      structure within this pattern is a function of both temperature and
      incidence angle. Because of this variability, it has not been
      characterized well enough to be removed in the pipeline calibration.
      The pattern is visible in the frames before the Moon has entered the
      slit, due to the scattered light from the bright surface of the
      Moon. It is also seen after the Moon has entered the slit but is not
      as obvious because the increased signal reduces the contrast.
 
 
    Timing
    ------
      The EPOXI project plans to generate a complete and highly accurate
      set of UTC correlations since launch.  This will ultimately result
      in a future version of a SCLK that will retroactively change
      correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI data.  When this
      kernel is available, it will be added to the SPICE data sets for
      the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE web site at
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.   If time and funding permit, the
      EPOXI project will provide more precise times for archived data.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in 2005
      indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus
      problem does not significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more
      details please see the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels are included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the EPOXI:MINIMUM and EPOXI:MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the reference rows and columns
      located at the edges of the image.  For more information, see the
      quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
