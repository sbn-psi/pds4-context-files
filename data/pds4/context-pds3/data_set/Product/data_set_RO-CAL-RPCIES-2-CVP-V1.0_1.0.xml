    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The following describes the nature of instrument operation
      during the various periods for which IES data are available in
      this submission.  In all cases the data are raw electron and
      ion counts as function of energy, azimuth (direction in the
      instrument symmetry plane) and elevation (angle above or below
      the symmetry plane).  Except for most of the data obtained
      during the first Earth Swingby (ESB1) all data were obtained in
      the solar wind near 1 AU.  The period from March to October
      2004 represent various phases of instrument commissioning, i.e.
      the first exercises of IES in space after launch.
 
      September 8-10, 2004.  This data set was obtained during the
      first high voltage turn-on in space and shows that IES fully
      survived launch. The data clearly show the expected solar wind
      protons and alpha particles as well as the electron
      distribution.
 
      September 20-23 and October 13-14, 2004.  This data set was
      obtained during the so-called &apos;Interference Scenario&apos; to
      investigate any possible electrical interference between
      instruments or spacecraft subsystems.  Various combinations of
      instruments were operated at different times, hence the
      intermittent nature of the IES data.
 
      September 23 &amp; 30, 2004.  This data set was obtained during the
      so-called &apos;Pointing Scenario&apos; to investigate any spacecraft
      attitude effects on the payload.  Hence the IES data show the
      solar wind beam changing in direction as the spacecraft
      orientation changed.
 
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      N/A
 
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      All Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) data packets are transmitted
      together during downlinks with Rosetta. RPC data are retrieved
      from the Data Distribution System (DDS) at European Space
      Operations Centre (ESOC) to a central RPC data server at
      Imperial College London. Data for IES is copied from the RPC
      central data server by IESGS at Southwest Research Institute.
 
      The pipeline processing software is the IES Ground System
      (IESGS). IESGS extracts IES CCSDS packets from the RPC
      collective data files stored on the RPC central data server at
      Imperial College. These packets are used to build ion and
      electron data products. The data products are grouped by date
      and written out to PDS compliant archive data files. One data
      file is created for each mode used in each day. IESGS also
      generates the labels for the archive data files. IES science
      products, archive and label files, and limited spectrograms are
      available to team scientists on the IESGS website.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This dataset is used by the IES science team after processing.
      This is done to ensure that the archived data contains good
      valid products.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by the IES science team
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      It will later be subject to a reviews by PDS and the Rosetta
      data archive working group.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================

    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
