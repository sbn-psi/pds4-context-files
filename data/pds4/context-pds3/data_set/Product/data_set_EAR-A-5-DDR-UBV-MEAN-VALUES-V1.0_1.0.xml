            Compiled mean U-B abd B-V color indices of asteroids

        <abstract_desc>
            This is a compilation of mean U-B and B-V color indices of
            asteroids. This data file was provided by E.F. Tedesco, MRC and
            is a *preliminary* version. The version actually published will
            include UBV observations published through 1994 and the
            individual, referenced and commented, observations from which the
            average value was obtained. This dataset presents Johnson system
            U-B and B-V colors (or colors transformable to them) for
            asteroids, obtained between 1951 and 1989 and published through
            mid-1990. In addition, it uses Ted Bowell&apos;s unpublished
            observations from the Lowell UBV Asteroid Survey. The 978 mean
            U-B color indices are derived from 3,476 U-B observations. The
            1,020 mean B-V color indices are derived from 4,010 B-V
            observations.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
  This is a compilation of mean U-B and B-V color indices of
  asteroids.  This data file was provided by E.F. Tedesco, MRC and is
  a *preliminary* version. The version actually published will
  include UBV observations published through 1994 and the individual,
  referenced and commented, observations from which the average value
  was obtained. This dataset presents Johnson system U-B and B-V
  colors (or colors transformable to them) for asteroids, obtained
  between 1951 and 1989 and published through mid-1990.  In addition,
  it uses Ted Bowell&apos;s unpublished observations from the Lowell UBV
  Asteroid Survey. The 978 mean U-B color indices are derived from
  3,476 U-B observations.  The 1,020 mean B-V color indices are
  derived from 4,010 B-V observations.  The details of this synthesis
  will be submitted for publication in the future. For additional
  information contact Ed Tedesco.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
  The data are presented in one ASCII file, &apos;ubvavg.tab&apos;.  The file
  contains one entry for each asteroid, with fields for the following
  paramenters.  Catalog number of the asteroid, provisional
  designation (for data published under the provisional designation
  only), and for both U-B and B-V the mean color index, the standard
  deviation of the mean color index, the number of observations used
  to compute the mean value, and the minimum, maximum, and mean phase
  angles of the asteroid in the set of observations used to compute
  the mean.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
  The U-B and B-V values presented here are the unweighted averages
  of color indices compiled from the published literature.  The full
  dataset including the source data and references will be
  incorporated into the PDS when the compilation has been published,
  sometime in the future.
 
 
  Data
  ====
  The data are included in the ASCII data table &apos;ubvavg.tab&apos;.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
  This dataset is released in the form of ASCII files which may be
  stored on disk or other magnetic media and which may be distributed
  by ftp, email, realtime access by remote login, or by whatever
  means is most convenient.

  Review
  ======
  This dataset underwent a formal external review on March 31, 1995.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
  This dataset includes data published through mid-1990.  The
  complete dataset including source data and references, which will
  be complete through 1994, will be released in the future.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
  This dataset is a compilation of data taken from the published
  literature, as well as unpublished data from the Lowell UBV
  Asteroid Survey.  It is a provisional data product and will be
  replaced with the complete product in the future.
