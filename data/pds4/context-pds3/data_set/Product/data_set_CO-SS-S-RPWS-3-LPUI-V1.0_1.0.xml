  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe
    Sweep voltage-current data set comprises calibrated
    Voltage-Current (U-I) characteristics acquired almost continuously
    from most mission  phases during the entire Cassini mission.  This
    particular data set includes spacecraft event time, bias voltage,
    and measured current for each sampled data point.  Data are
    presented in tables organised so as to have fixed-length records
    for ease in data handling.  These can be used to derive higher
    level data products like thermal plasma parameters, e.g., electron
    density and temperature.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    This data set comprises spacecraft event time, bias voltage, and
    measured  current for each sampled data point that was acquired by
    the RPWS.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw
    telemetry packets into complete sets then de-compress the data
    that were compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms
    by the RPWS flight software onboard. The conversion from telemetry
    data to physical measured electric current units is made through
    lookup tables created by two 3rd order polynomial fits to the
    ground tests calibration data. The ground test calibration data
    are presented in Chapter 9 of the  RPWSCAL document in the
    DOCUMENT directory.  These data are calibrated using the best
    calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data
    were archived.
 
    The sweep data themselves consist of 0.5s long current-voltage
    characteristics consisting of 512 or 1024 samples each. The sweeps
    are usually made every 24s during targeted moon flybys or during
    inner magnetosphere crossings, or every 600s during survey mode.
    The bias voltage sweep range is most often between +/-32V, except
    for Titan flybys below 1200km altitude where the voltage range  is
    +/-4V.  The voltage sweeps are usually swept from both negative
    and positive voltage bias (i.e., two sweeps occur per 0.5s) to
    check for hysteresis artefacts.  Some of the sweep data show data
    spikes of external interference origin. These have not been
    corrected for, but  can easily be filtered away by the user.
 
    There are several literature references regarding how to do
    analyse Langmuir probe sweeps, and the following references,
    specific for  the RPWS Langmuir probe analysis, are probably
    useful: Titan ionosphere: Wahlund et al., 2005; Shebanits et al.,
    2013 Enceladus plume: Morooka et al., 2011 Inner plasma disk:
    Gustafsson &amp; Wahlund, 2010; Holmberg et al., 2012 Outer
    magnetosphere proxy density data: Morooka et al., 2009. The
    Langmuir probe spherical sensor is 5 cm in diameter, and coated
    with TiN.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The RPWS Langmuir Probe sweep voltage-current data set is given
    as daily ASCII tables of three columns. The first column is
    spacecraft event time (SCET), the second column is the set bias
    potential in volts, and the third column is the measured current
    in amps.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Ancillary data archived separately with volume set id
    USA_NASA_PDS_CORPWS_0XXX include a series of files that describe
    the modes of the RPWS as a function of time and provide a
    time-ordered listing of Instrument Expanded Block (IEB) trigger
    commands (the mode by which the RPWS is reconfigured). Also a
    detailed description of each of the modes (or IEBs) is provided.
 
    Other data which are ancillary to this data set and which are
    archived separately from this collection are the Navigation and
    Ancillary Information Facility&apos;s SPICE kernels describing the
    position and attitude of Cassini and various solar system bodies
    as a function of time.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The data in this data set are calibrated Voltage-Current
    characteristics measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe. These data
    are presented as detected by the sensor and are not rotated into
    any other coordinate system.  If desired, the SPICE kernels can be
    used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the spacecraft frame
    to virtually any frame which may be of use in analysing these
    data.  However, for most  purposes, the data may be considered
    point measurements at Cassini (a Langmuir probe Voltage sweep is
    at most 0.5s long) and may be entirely adequate with no coordinate
    transformations at all.  However, for analysis purposes using this
    data set, the photo-electron cloud around the spacecraft, the
    photo-electron emission from the Langmuir probe itself, as well as
    possible ram plasma wake effects will indeed depend on the
    orientation of the spacecraft versus the solar and plasma ram flow
    directions.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    These data are supplied to the Planetary Data System as an online
    collection of files in a PDS volume directory structure or as a
    standard compressed archive, such as ZIP or TAR.GZ, of this
    collection.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set contains calibrated Voltage-Current characteristics
    acquired by the Cassini RPWS Langmuir probe for the interval
    described below. Every effort has been made to ensure that all
    data returned to JPL from the spacecraft is included and that the
    calibration is accurate. The noise level of the Langmuir probe is
    estimated to be close to 100 pA derived from the sampled current
    data for negative bias voltage in thin plasma regions (&lt;0.1
    cm**-3).  Calibration and other systematic errors are smaller than
    the noise level.  In micro-meter sized dust regions the individual
    dust hits  can be seen as spikes in the voltage sweep data.  These
    have not been corrected for since it contains potential science
    results.  Furthermore, some of the sweep data show artificial data
    spikes of external interference origin. These have not been
    corrected either, but can easily be filtered away by the user.
    Wake effects may also affect the quality of the data if the probe
    is in the wake of the spacecraft.  The voltage-current
    characteristics data set has otherwise a very good confidence
    level.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The RPWS Langmuir probe sweep calibrated data will be reviewed
    internally by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS.
    The data set will also be peer reviewed by the PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general,
    the  RPWS/LP instrument started to operate just after launch in
    1997, thereafter with intermittent operation periods near Earth
    and Jupiter flybys until three months before Saturn Orbit
    Insertion (SOI).  The RPWS/LP was thereafter operated more or less
    continuously from SOI and forward, and gave higher resolution data
    during each moon flyby.  Data gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly
    resolution or simply to downlink gaps, some of which were imposed
    by limitations on DSN station availability.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps has an interference
    in individual sweep samples. The RPWS HFR receiver give these
    interference signals in the LPR in certain negative bias voltage
    ranges.  These samples can been easily filtered away before
    analysis and should not pose a problem for the user analysis that
    deliver output parameters.  The user will find out that thermal
    electron output data will usually not be available, due to
    spacecraft photoelectron current contamination, for number
    densities below 1 cm**-3 and/or for temperatures above 10eV. The
    thermal ion ram current is usually not detectable below 5-10
    cm**-3.  Derived electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be
    regarded as uncertain, as the rms electric field surface
    variability of the spherical TiN coated probes is 0.015eV, and the
    number of sweep samples used for the temperature estimation
    becomes small (4-5 samples out of 1024 samples over +/-4V).
