  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains calibrated images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 acquired
    by the Deep Impact Impactor Targeting Sensor Visible CCD (ITS) during
    the encounter phase of the mission.  These observations were used for
    optical and autonomous navigation (NAV) of the impactor spacecraft as
    well as for scientific investigations.  These data were collected
    on 3-4 July 2005.
 
    Software on board the impactor spacecraft used the optical navigation
    (OpNav) and autonomous navigation (AutoNav) images to compute the
    brightness centroid of the target body for trajectory corrections.
    Optical navigation was used until two hours before impact when
    the AutoNav system took control of the impactor spacecraft.  For
    more information about the AutoNav system, see Mastrodemos, et. al
    (2005) [MASTRODEMOSETAL2005].
 
    A NAV observation consisted of one or more packets of data, each
    containing an 80-byte header plus a rectangle of image data called a
    &apos;&apos;snip&apos;&apos;, cropped from a full-frame image.  Pixels outside the snips
    were not returned.  The Deep Impact Science Data Center (SDC) at
    Cornell University, used the packets for one observation to
    reconstruct a raw, full-frame image of 1008 by 1008 pixels with one
    common header.  The data pipeline flagged pixels outside the snips
    as missing but did not capture the locations of the snips within
    a frame.  The raw, reconstructed images were then input to the
    calibration pipeline at the SDC.  For more information about the
    calibrated NAV images, see the processing section below.
 
    Reduced NAV images were grouped into daily directories by mid-
    observation date.  A list of the NAV images in the data set is
    provided here:

      DII-C-ITS-3/4-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0    : Calibrated ITS encounter data
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    The reduced, two-dimensional FITS images in this data set were
    generated by the Deep Impact calibration pipeline, maintained by the
    project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  The NAV
    images report, listed above in the recommended reading section,
    discusses how the NAV snips were processed into raw images and
    describes the steps performed by the calibration pipeline to reduced
    the raw data.  A summary is provided here.
 
    NAV images were typically acquired during sequences designed to gather
    science data.  The major difference between a science and NAV image
    was that a NAV observation was made of one or more packets of data,
    each containing an 80-byte header plus a rectangle of image data
    called a &apos;&apos;snip&apos;&apos;.  Because the snips were cropped from a full-frame
    image, not all pixels were returned in many cases.  However, some
    images were returned in full as a single snip of 1008 by 1008 pixels.
 
    Because a raw NAV observation was received as one or more snips, the
    SDC reconstructed a full frame of 1008 by 1008 pixels from the snips
    and stored the results as raw a FITS file.  These minimally processed
    FITS files were archived as the raw NAV data sets in the PDS.
 
    Since the raw NAV data excluded the serial- and parallel-overclock
    pixels around the edges of the array, the SDC pre-processed the raw
    NAV FITS images to include this information to make the data look
    enough like a 1024x1024-pixel, full-frame science image so that the
    existing calibration pipeline could be used.
 
    The pipeline performed the following reduction steps to produce the
    reduced FITS images in this data set:
 
      - Calibration of temperatures in the FITS header
      - Linearization of data number values
      - Correction for bias (using pre-determined values from the
        BIASVAL1, BIASVAL2, BIASVAL3, and BIASVAL4 entries in the
        PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS labels)
      - Subtraction of a dark frame
      - Application of a flat field to normalize the data
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration
 
    The following calibration steps were disabled (however, calibration
    files associated with some of these steps, such tables for removing
    cross-talk, were included in the calibration subdirectory for
    completeness):
 
      - Decompression (NAV data were never compressed)
      - Calibration of temperatures in the FITS header
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk and smear
      - Normalization of quadrant gains (included in flat fields)
      - Correction for uneven bit weighting due to analog-to-digital
        (ADC) conversion (a unit correction)
      - Gap filling
      - Removal of random gaussian noise
      - Despiking
      - Deconvolution
      - Geometric calibration
 
    The resulting data were provided in physical units of radiance,
    Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron).  These data, designated by the
    mnemonic &apos;&apos;RADREV&apos;&apos;, were not cleaned and are considered reversible
    because the calibration steps can be removed to get back to the
    original, raw data numbers.
 
    During the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension, so the
    following types of pixels could be identified:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information
      - Pixels considered bad as indicated by bad pixel maps
 
    The pipeline also created a second FITS image extension for a
    pixel-by-pixel signal-to-noise ratio map.
 
    The calibration steps and files used to reduce each raw image are
    listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS data label
    for that  image.  For a detailed discussion of the calibration
    pipeline and the resulting data, see the instrument calibration
    document by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files was
      Ixcccccccccc_eeeeeee_nnn_RR.LBL or FIT, where:
 
        I          : ITS instrument
        x          : Image usage (A for AutoNav or O for OpNav)
        cccccccccc : Spacecraft clock count at the image mid-point
        eeeeeee    : Exposure ID, same as for science data; image number
                     within an exposure ID was always 1 of 1
        yyyy       : Ground-received time (GRT) year
        ddd        : GRT day of year
        hhmmss     : GRT hours, minutes, and seconds
        nnn        : Sequentially increasing image number within
                     an exposure ID (always 1 of 1 for NAV data)
 
      It is important to note that a different file naming convention
      was used for the raw NAV images.  A cross-reference of the raw
      and calibrated NAV file names is included on the documentation
      volume.
 
 
    FITS CCD Images
    ---------------
      The two-dimensional, CCD images in this data set are in FITS format.
      The primary data array contains the image, followed by two image
      extensions that are pixel-by-pixel maps which provide additional
      information about the primary image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data label defines the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each image FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS label.  For
      more information about the FITS primary image and extensions, refer
      to the instrument calibration document.
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;&apos;As Seen By Observer&apos;&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the data labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = &apos;UP&apos;
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
      Using this convention for Tempel 1 approach images, ecliptic East is
      toward the left, ecliptic North is up, and the Sun is to the right.
      This was also the convention used when displaying science images of
      Tempel 1 in published papers.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation of ITS flight images with those
      from ground-based calibrations as well as those from the High and
      Medium Resolution Instrument CCDs (HRIV and MRI, respectively), see
      the quadrant nomenclature section of the &apos;Deep Impact Instrument
      Calibration&apos; document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Reduced RADREV data are in units of radiance, W/(m**2 steradian
      micron).  The data are reversible and are not cleaned.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      The unbinned, full-frame, instrument mode 1 was always used for
      NAV images.  For descriptions of the imaging modes, please see
      the Deep Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005].
 
      During pre-processing, the SDC added overclock rows and columns
      around the edges of the raw NAV FITS images so that the data could
      be processed by the calibration pipeline used for the science
      images.  Pixels in the overclock areas were excluded from the
      calculation of the values for MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and
      STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      Although the time to impact was not calculated for the NAV data,
      the estimated time of impact at the impactor spacecraft was UTC
      05:44:34.200 on 4 Jul 2005.  This is based on the conclusions
      presented in the spacecraft clock correlation document.
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE in the data labels specified the
      the direction of ecliptic north as projected onto the image plane.
      It is measured from the &apos;upward&apos; direction, clockwise to the
      direction toward ecliptic north when the image is displayed as
      defined by the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION
      keywords.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the
      proper geometric information for the target of choice in many
      cases.  When these parameters could not be computed, the
      corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were set to a
      value of unknown (UNK).  Geometry-related keywords for most
      calibration targets were set to UNK.
 
      Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
      the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
      and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
      calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
      earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
      left the target.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second uncertainty between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations and an uncertainty of about one half of a
      second between the clocks on the flyby and impactor spacecraft.
      These improved kernels were included in the DI SPICE data set
      and were used to calculate the geometric parameters in the PDS
      data labels.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
      see the spacecraft clock correlation report provided on the DI
      documentation volume, DIDOC_0001.
 
      The SPICE kernels used to calculated the geometric parameters are
      provided by the SPICE_FILE_NAME keyword in the PDS data labels.  The
      kernels were listed in the order they were loaded into memory for
      processing.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the DI SPICE data set archived in the PDS.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep
    Impact documentation volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used by the science team for photometric
    analysis of 9P/Tempel 1.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set was peer-reviewed in November 2006 and was accepted
    for the PDS archive pending resolution of liens (completed in June
    2007).
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All expected data were received on the ground and are included in
    this data set.  There are gaps in the exposure IDs in some daily
    data directories because NAV frames were interspersed with science
    frames.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    1/3 Pixel Gap
    -------------
      There is a 1/3-pixel, horizontal gap for a clocking phase between
      the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  It was inserted by the
      manufacturer to facilitate the simultaneous upward and downward
      reading of the upper and lower quadrants.  The gap causes a
      10 percent reduction in the sensitivity of the two central rows
      (i.e., one row immediately above the gap and one below it).
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      A log scale is recommended for displaying reduced NAV images. Use
      the values of the the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM keywords in the PDS data
      label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS header) to set the
      range.  While the overclock rows and columns located around the edge
      of the image were not included in these values, the pixels outside
      the snips were.
