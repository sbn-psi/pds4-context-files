Overview:
=========
 
This data set provides energetic (MeV) ion count rates and events
measured by the Heavy Ion Counter (HIC) instrument on the Galileo
spacecraft. The data are derived from the raw real-time science (RTS)
data.  There are two basic types of data files associated with the
full-rate reduced data: Detector Count Rates and Events (Pulse Heights).
Both types of files set are stored as ASCII tables, where the file
parameters are functions of time.  Appropriate information concerning
the operation of the instrument can be found in Garrard, Gehrels and
Stone, Space Sci.  Rev., 60, 305, 1992 [GARRARDETAL1992].
 
This data set is highly discontinuous in time. Because of the severe
limitations in the downlink capability of the Galileo spacecraft,
data were acquired for only selected portions of each orbit. During
the prime mission (first 12 orbits), continuous data were acquired
inside of 50 Rj for all orbits, with a few select orbits having
complete or nearly complete coverage in the Real-Time Science (RTS)
telemetry mode. During most of the Galileo Europa Mission (GEM) and
Galileo Millennium Mission (GMM) coverage was more limited, typically
only a few days around perijove, except for the Cassini encounter
period (orbits 28 and 29) and orbits where recorded data were lost
due to spacecraft safings or other mishaps. Table 1 below provides
a listing of the start and stop times of the data for each orbit.
Some orbits (5 and 13) have no coverage due to solar conjunctions.
Table 2 below provides basic information about the orbits and
orbital geometry. After the insertion orbit, which dipped as low as
five degrees south, the Galileo remained within a degree of the
jovian equator.

Processing:
===========
 
The data are processed from the level 2 data obtained from the Query
Server at JPL.  The rate files are a level 3 product where the instrument
counting rates have been converted into units of counts/second and are
given at full time resolution.
 
The event files are a level 3 product where the event data has been
extracted from the data stream, a nuclear charge (Z) of each event has
been calculated along with the appropriate livetime and geometry factor.
The energy deposited in each of three detectors is also given in MeV.
 
Every 2 seconds the HIC instrument zeros the rate counters and begins
accumulation.  One event per minor frame is selected (based
on a priority scheme) and transmitted to the spacecraft along with 2 - 3
rates. Some of the less important / scientifically interesting rates are
subcommutated and thus only transmitted once every 16 HIC packets (1 HIC
packet equals 3 minor frames equals 2 seconds).  The data, with 2 second
time resolution, consists of (up to) 3 events and 8 rates.
 
The different rates respond to different energy ranges.  These are given in
MeV/nucleon (for oxygen) below:

It was determined that at times the LETB sensor was mistagging events.
A check was implemented in the ground event processing to determine
the correct tag for a given event based on the returned pulse heights.
An extended set of event types (given below) were created to indicate
those events which were originally mistagged.  For these events no Z
(nuclear charge) or livetime value is determined.  It is possible to
group the events, based on the pulse heights, into 3 basic
compositional categories (S, Na or S, and O or Na or S).

pulse heights the events can be reclassified.

Ancillary Data:
===============
 
There are no ancillary data uniquely associated with the HIC
reduced data archive. However, the spacecraft trajectory and
attitude data, and the As-run Spacecraft Events Files that are
provided on the same archive volume as these data are useful
ancillary products for users of the HIC data.
 
 
Coordinate System:
==================
 
These are scalar data.
 
 
Software:
=========
 
There is no software provided with this archive.
 
 
Media/Format:
=============
 
Event Data:
-----------
  The Event data are stored as a simple ASCII data table.  The first 18
  lines of the original data file consisted of a header that has been
  moved to the PDS label (file and data info sections).  The header
  contained summary information describing the 12 columns of data.
  The summary includes:
 
  - Count of adjustments by event type -
    Occasionally portions of data required for processing at this level
    is missing from instrument records. In these cases a default
    &apos;livetime&apos; value has been supplied. The number of times this
    &apos;adjustment&apos; was performed is reported by event type.
  - Count of events by event type -
    Event TYPE values that fall within the set (see below for explanation
    of the set) of expected values are counted.
    The accumulated count of these events are reported here by event type.
 
  - Number of bad event types -
    Only certain values are expected in the TYPE field. Event TYPE
    values falling outside the set of expected values are counted.
    The accumulated count of these events are reported here.
 
  Each data line consists of a PDS date/time string, an spacecraft
  clock (SLK) counter string and 10 numeric fields. These fields
  are all floating point with the exception of the &apos;DateTime&apos;, &apos;SCLK&apos;
  and &apos;TYPE&apos; columns.
 
  The data are contained in ASCII format.
 
 
  The columns are in the following order:

  Data Processing section.
 
 
Rate Data:
----------
  The Rate data are stored as a simple ASCII data table.  The first
  4 lines of the original data file consisted of a header that has been
  moved to the PDS label (file and data info sections).  The header
  contained summary column headings for the 17 columns of data plus some
  summary data.  The summary typically consists of a descriptor and an
  identifier in the form:
 
        xxx: yyy
 
  where xxx is a single word descriptor and yyy is an identifier.
  Examples:
        TYPE: PB2R
        DATE: 96/02/25
 
  Rate data are stored in 3 different files, all covering the same time range
  (SURVEY_RATE_LOW_RES, SURVEY_RATE_LOW_RES, SURVEY_RATE_LOW_RES )
  The records in each file contain the same style of time index but have
  different rate counters in each file (see below).  Data were delivered
  from the spacecraft with multiple samples per data packet.  Each data packet
  contains only one spacecraft clock (SCLK) value.  SCLK is only provided for
  records where it is known to be accurate.  A counter internal to the HIC
  instrument was used to produce times for the other samples.

General:
========
 
The rate data has been thoroughly checked by the HIC team and includes the
highest resolution data available for this orbit.  Please direct any
questions regarding the generation or interpretation of the data to
PDS_OPERATOR@jpl.nasa.gov.
 
Specific:
=========
 
During the J0 orbit the coincidence requirement for the LETB rate was cycled
from requiring 3 detectors to requiring 2 detectors to requiring only 1
detector to be triggered.  This changes the energy threshold of the rate from
6.5 to 4.8 to 2.4 MeV/nucleon.  The times of the coincidence requirement
changes are given below:
