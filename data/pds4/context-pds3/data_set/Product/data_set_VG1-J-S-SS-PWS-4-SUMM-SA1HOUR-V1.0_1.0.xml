            This data set contains hourly RMS averages and peaks of
            calibrated electric field measurements taken by the spectrum
            analyzer component of the Plasma Wave System (PWS) onboard
            Voyager 1 for the entire mission. Most noise spikes were removed
            prior to processing in order to provide more reliable values.
            Each record contains the spacecraft event time at the beginning
            of the processed hour, 16 RMS electric field averages
            corresponding to the 16 frequency channels of the instrument
            ranging from 50 Hz to 10 kHz, and 16 maximum values in the same
            units for the same frequencies.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data from
    the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the entire
    mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive on subsequent
    volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum analyzer
    observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between,
    and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases as well as those
    obtained during the two encounter phases.
 
    The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 90 AU over the
    course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when some key
    events occurred during the mission, the following table is provided.

  Data Sampling
  =============
    This data set consists of average and peak wave electric field
    intensities accumulated over 1-hour intervals from the Voyager 1
    Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained during the entire
    mission.  For each 1-hour time interval squares of the calibrated
    electric field measurements obtained during each hour-long interval
    in each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels are summed and then
    divided by the number of measurements.  The square root of the
    resulting value is obtained and stored as the average electric field
    strength for the respective channel.  During the same hour-long
    interval, the maximum electric field strength acquired in each of
    the 16 channels is also recorded and stored as the peak electric
    field strength for the respective channel.  Hence, for each hour, an
    average and peak electric field spectrum from 10 Hz to 56.2 kHz is
    obtained.  The 16 spectrum analyzer channels have center frequencies
    that range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and are logarithmically
    spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated
    with each peak and average spectrum is the time of the beginning of
    the averaging interval.  Given variations in the sweep rate of the
    instrument (from a minimum of 4 seconds/sweep to a maximum of 96
    seconds/sweep) the maximum number of samples in an hour-long
    interval can range from 900 to 38.  Data gaps within the interval
    can further reduce the number of samples.
 
    During data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries
    exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged
    in any other way.
 
 
  Data Processing
  ===============
    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are
    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as
    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one
    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds in
    the full-resolution data set, depending on telemetry mode.) This
    data set includes one-hour average and peak values for each channel.
    The data are typically plotted as amplitude vs. time for one or more
    of the channels in a strip-chart like display, or can be displayed
    as a frequency-time spectrogram using a gray- or color-bar to
    indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen channels, it is usually best
    to stretch the frequency axis by interpolating from one frequency
    channel to the next either linearly or with a spline fit.  One must
    be aware if the frequency axis is stretched that more resolution may
    be implied than is really present.
 
    The measurements provided in the average and peak electric field
    spectra included in this data set are in units of electric field
    (volts/meter).
 
    Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of the
    electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the
    corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.
 
      specdens = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan)
 
    Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral density
    by the impedance of free space in ohms:
 
      pwrflux = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73

    channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:

  Data
  ====
    The average and peak spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where
    data are available) low resolution data set which provides wave
    intensity as a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and
    time (one spectrum per hour).  Each sample is a floating point
    electric field strength in units of volts/meter.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    None
 
 
  Coordinates
  ===========
    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole
    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.
    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured field to
    any particular direction such as the local magnetic field or
    direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft usually
    remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously.
    Furthermore, even during the rare times when the spacecraft is
    turned, the hour-long averages in this data set would almost
    completely mask any modulation caused by the rotating dipole antenna
    pattern.

  Overview
  ========
    This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data acquired
    during the Voyager 1 mission to date.  The data set near planetary
    encounters has been cleaned prior to averaging for periodic noise
    spikes due to a stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated
    grid within the PLS.  Other spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz due to
    the operation of attitude control thrusters have not been removed.
    Telemetry errors appear in the full resolution data set as
    randomly-occurring spikes over the entire frequency range.  No
    attempt has been made to remove such spikes because of the
    difficulty of differentiating between them and valid data, i.e. real
    bursts of wave activity.  The spikes, therefore, can adversely
    affect the averaged values.  The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes
    contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument, depending on
    that instrument&apos;s mode.  This interference is at a relatively
    constant level.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel prior to
    its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The peer review
    was conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
    Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data set, key
    elements of the archive were distributed for preliminary review.
    These included electronic versions of example PDS labels, CATALOG
    files, and Software Interface Specifications.  These materials were
    distributed to PDS personnel, the experiment investigator, and
    others, as appropriate.
