    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a
      Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on
      a common pivot platform. This dataset includes the Experiment Data
      Record (EDR) version of all available images acquired during the
      cruise phase to Mercury and includes post-launch checkout images,
      flyby images of Earth, Venus, Mercury, images acquired from Mercury
      orbit, and in-flight calibration images. This EDR dataset is the
      primary record of image data as it was received on Earth. The images
      in this dataset have not been processed in any way other than by
      decompressing, extracting header information, and generating and
      attaching PDS labels. This dataset also includes ancillary data
      files that tabulate the contents of the volume and documentation
      files.
 
      File names follow the structure:
      &apos;pcrnnnnnnnnnf&apos;, where
 
         p = product type = E for raw EDRs
         c = camera (W WAC or N NAC)
         r = spacecraft-clock-partition-number minus 1 [0, 1], associates
             with pre- or post-spacecraft-clock-reset
         nnnnnnnnn = Mission Elapsed Time (MET) counter taken from the
                      image header (and same as original compressed
                      filename from SSR). NOTE: this a spacecraft clock
                      seconds counter, and the value in the filename
                      corresponds to the LAST second of the exposure.
         f = Filter wheel position (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, U)
             for the WAC.  It is M for the NAC, which has no filter wheel.
             It is U if the position is unknown.
 
      For more information on the contents and organization of the volume
      set refer to the aareadme.txt file located in the root directory of
      the data volumes.
 
    Versions
    ========
 
      The image content of EDRs has been unchanged to date.
 
      Beginning with MDIS PDS release 4 containing data through Mercury
      flyby 2, the labels were modified to include information on image
      statistics such as minimum, maximum, and mean values.
 
      Beginning in MDIS PDS release 5, which contains data through Mercury
      flyby 3, labeling of EDRs was updated in response to an MDIS
      flight software upload in August 2009. Several additional items of
      housekeeping were added to the headers of downlinked images, and
      propagated into the EDR labels.
 
      Beginning in MDIS PDS release 6, which contains data through the
      beginning of Mercury orbit, three additional items were added to
      EDR labels providing information on timing and image targeting.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      MDIS observing scenarios are constructed using a set of key
      variables (&apos;configurations&apos;) which include the following. All, with
      the exception of filter selection, are available for both the NAC
      and the WAC. Only the WAC has selectable filters. The imagers can
      only be used one at a time.
 
      Compression: MDIS images may optionally be compressed in a number
      of ways, including pixel binning on-chip, 12-8 bit compression, and
      FAST/Differential pulse code modulation (DCPM) lossless
      compression, all carried out in the instrument hardware; further
      pixel binning, subframing, wavelet compression, and jailbars, are
      all carried out in the spacecraft Main Processor (MP), either
      individually or in combinations.
 
      Pixel Binning: MDIS images can undergo 2x2 pixel binning in the
      focal plane hardware (also known as &apos;on-chip&apos; binning), resulting
      in a 512 x 512 image. Images can also be compressed using the MP,
      either in addition to DPU binning, or instead of DPU binning. MP
      pixel binning options of 2x2, 4x4 or 8x8 are available.
 
      12-8 bit compression: Images are read off the detector in 12-bit
      format. 12 bit images may converted to 8 bit images using lookup
      tables (LUTs) designed to preferentially retain information at low,
      medium, or high 12-bit DN values. Eight LUTs are available, and
      shared between the NAC and WAC.
 
      FAST/DPCM compression: All images are compressed losslessly using
      FAST/DCPM compression as they are read out of the DPU, to conserve
      recorder space. Once the data are written to the recorder, they can
      be uncompressed and recompressed more aggressively in the MP.
 
      Wavelet compression: Images may be integer wavelet transform-
      compressed in the MP, typically at 3:1 for color data and 4:1 for
      monochrome data, but any value from 1 to 32 can be used.
 
      Subframing: In order to manage downlink resources, up to 5 portions
      of the image can be selected in the MP and downlinked as subframes.
      The subframes are allowed to overlap. During EDR construction the
      subframes are all mosaicked into the original image.
      During orbital operations this option is not regularly used.
 
      Jailbars: Intended for data management during optical navigation,
      jailbars are selected columns of an image retained by the MP.
      Commanded column spacing values are not restricted and can be
      set to any integer value between 1 and 1024, but the spacing is
      fixed throughout the image. During EDR construction the
      jailbars are all mosaicked into the original image.
      During flight this option is not regularly used.
 
      Exposure Control: The exposure time of MDIS images can be set
      manually by command, or automatically by the software. In manual
      mode, exposure times from 1-989, 1001-1989, ..., to 9001-9989 ms
      are available. In autoexposure mode the exposure time of the next
      image is computed by the DPU software, and cannot exceed 989 ms
      in duration. If the time of the next image occurs before the
      calculation can be completed, and pixel binning or filter
      position change, then the algorithm compensates for predicted
      changes in scene brightness and filter transmission using an
      onboard data structure.
 
      Pointing: The MDIS imagers are mounted on a pivot platform, which
      is itself mounted to the MESSENGER spacecraft deck. The pivot
      platform is controlled by a stepper motor, which is controlled by
      the Data Processing Unit (DPU). The pivot platform can move in
      either direction. The total range of motion is 240 degrees, limited
      by mechanical &apos;hard&apos; stops, and is further constrained by &apos;soft&apos;
      stops applied by the software. The nominal pointing position for
      MDIS is defined as 0 degrees, aligned with the spacecraft +Z axis
      and the boresight for several other instruments. The range of the
      soft stops is set to 40 degrees in the spacecraft -Y direction
      (toward the MESSENGER sunshade) and +50 degrees in the +Y direction
      (away from the sunshade). The pivot position can be commanded in
      intervals of 0.01 degrees within this range.
 
      Filter selection: The WAC imager contains a 12 position filter
      wheel to provide spectral imaging over the spectral range of the
      CCD detector. Eleven spectral filters span the range from 395 to
      1040 nm, while the twelfth position is a broadband filter for
      optical navigation.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      An MDIS image downlinked by the spacecraft unpacks into a
      succession of one or more compressed image subframes with binary
      headers containing housekeeping items that contain full status of
      the instrument hardware, including imager, software configuration,
      temperature, voltage, and current readings, pivot position, and a
      time stamp.
 
      The data in one EDR consists of a single reconstructed image frame,
      with the accompanying header translated into text format in the
      label. Each frame has dimensions of spatial samples in the form of
      detector columns and detector rows. Each frame is formatted into
      one file (suffix *.IMG), with an attached label.
 
      Each image has dimensions XX pixels in the sample dimension and YY
      pixels in the line dimension, where:
 
      XX (columns) = 1024/binning, where 1024 is the number of columns
      read off the detector, and binning is 2, 4, or 8 (the product of
      binning at the instrument level and by the MP).
 
      YY (rows) = 1024/binning, where 1024 is the number of columns read
      off the detector, and binning is consistent with the sample
      binning.
 
      Subframes are not retained as separate entities and are reassembled
      into their original coordinates in the image. Parts of the
      reconstructed image not included in the subframes are given a value
      of zero.
 
      Pixel binning and 12-to-8 bit compression are not inverted at the
      EDR level.
 
      The label contains all of the housekeeping information in their raw
      form. Selected ones are listed in duplicate in calbrated form (e.g.
      degrees Celsius, volts, or amperes. In addition, value-added
      information in the label describes image pointing and objectives.
 
      Files needed to calibrate the EDRs to radiance or I/F are found in
      the CALIB directory where their usage is described. There are up to
      six successive corrections applied:
 
      (1) removal of dark current;
      (2) removal of frame transfer smear;
      (3) correction for minor detector non-linearity;
      (4) &apos;flat field&apos; correction for pixel-to-pixel response
          non-uniformity;
      (5) correction for detector responsivity and exposure time,
          yielding radiance;
      (6) division of radiance by the solar spectrum scaled by the
          square of solar distance, yielding I/F; and
      (7) optionally, application of an empirical correction for time
          variability of WAC responsivity.
 
      The calibration procedure is itself versioned.
 
      Version 1 was the prototype version produced internally to the MDIS
      team for validation.
 
      Version 2 was the first publicly released version of MDIS
      calibration, first released in MDIS PDS release 3 which contains
      data through Mercury flyby 1. In version 2 the calibrations
      of WAC filters 3 and 6 (C and F, at 480 and 433 nm) were adjusted
      from the version 1.
 
      Version 3 was first released in MDIS PDS release 4 containing data
      through Mercury flyby 2. In version 3 the accounting of CCD
      temperature in the responsivity correction was updated.
 
      Version 4 calibration was first released beginning in PDS release 9,
      which contains data from months 13-18 of Mercury orbit. In that
      update, four further corrections and additions to radiometric
      calibration are implemented. (a) A small error in calculation of
      the correction for frame transfer smear is corrected. (b) The
      flat-field correction for WAC filters 3 and 6 is updated. (c) The
      WAC temperature-dependent responsivity is updated again. (d) A new
      term &apos;Correct&apos; is added to the calibration equation to correct for
      time variation in responsivity in all WAC filters beginning in
      May 2011.
 
      Version 5 CDRs are released in PDS release 15, the final
      end-of-mission data release which includes all data. In this update,
      three further corrections and additions to radiometric calibration
      are implemented. (a) The flat-field correction for several WAC filters
      in non-binned and binned states is updated, using the same approach
      of normalized median values of low-contrast field filling images
      acquired during orbit, except using more images less affected by
      compression than in version 4 CDRs. (b) The NAC and WAC temperature-
      dependent responsivity are updated based on further analysis of
      images acquired at differing temperatures. (c) The &apos;Correct&apos; term
      in the calibration equation is updated based on extensive analysis
      of overlaps of images acquired at different times, and covers the
      entire period of Mercury orbit.
 
    Data
    ====
      There is only one data type associated with this volume, the raw
      uncalibrated DNs.
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      There are two types of ancillary data provided with this
      dataset:
 
      1. The GEOMETRY directory contains the file GEOMINFO.TXT that points
      to and describes the function of each SPICE kernel relevant to MDIS.
 
      2. The CALIB directory contains a summary of the processing
      required to convert raw data to units of radiance or I/F, as well
      as all of the matrices and coefficients needed. See CALINFO.TXT
      in that directory for more details.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      The cartographic coordinate system used for the MDIS data products
      conforms to the J2000 celestial reference frame for star imaging,
      and the IAU planetocentric system with East longitudes being
      positive for planetary surfaces. The IAU2000 reference system for
      cartographic coordinates and rotational elements was used for
      computing latitude and longitude coordinates of planets.
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      The MDIS archive is organized and stored in the directory
      structure described in the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS)
      Experimental Data Record (EDR) Software Interface Specification
      (SIS). The contents of the archive, along with fiduciary checksums,
      are compressed into a single &apos;zip archive&apos; file for transmittal to
      the PDS Imaging node.  The zip archive preserves the directory
      structure internally so that when it is decompressed the original
      directory structure is recreated at the PDS Imaging node.  The zip
      archive is transmitted to the PDS Imaging node via FTP to the URL
      specified by the node for receiving it.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This is a raw data set.  Known issues of concern are described
      below.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel prior
      to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The peer
      review was conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
      THE USER OF MDIS EXPERIMENT DATA RECORDS IS URGED TO EXAMINE
      THE DQI IN THE LABEL FOR POSSIBLE ISSUES OF DATA QUALITY, AND
      TO UNDERSTAND SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE DATA LISTED BELOW.
 
      The 16-byte Data Quality Index or DQI is used to encode
      figures-of-merit into one parameter, including automated
      assessments of validity of the exposure time, presence of an
      excessive number of pixels at or approaching saturation, validity
      of the reported pivot position, validity of the reported filter
      wheel position, quality of spacecraft attitude knowledge from the
      MESSENGER star cameras, CCD temperature within range that supports
      nominal image calibration accuracy, and completeness of data
      within the commanded selection of subframes or full frame.
 
      A &apos;1&apos; in any of the fields of the data quality index indicates a
      condition that could adversely affect data quality. A value of &apos;1&apos;
      in bytes 0, 1, or 4 leads to a raw image or EDR not being
      calibratable. A value of &apos;1&apos; in byte 2 indicates that radiance
      values derived from the columns of the image experiencing
      saturation in any row are either invalid or strongly suspect.
      A value of &apos;1&apos; in byte 3 or 5 means that even if the image is
      radiometrically accurate, its reconstructed pointing is suspect.
      A value of &apos;1&apos; in byte 6 (CCD out of temperature range at which
      radiometric calibration is well-constrained) is a warning and
      does not necessarily indicate invalid data.
 
      Byte 0: Image source is CCD.
        1 = Image source is test pattern as indicated by
            MESS:SOURCE=1=Test pattern or
            MESS:SOURCE=2=Inverted test pattern.
        0 = Image source is CCD as indicated by MESS:SOURCE=0=CCD.
 
      Byte 1: Valid exposure time.
        1 = Exposure time in ms as indicated by MESS:EXPOSURE equals 0 ms
            (during cruise) or is less than or equal to 2 ms (orbit).
        0 = Exposure time in ms as indicated by MESS:EXPOSURE is greater
            than or equal to minimum valid value.
 
      Byte 2: Presence of an excessive number of pixels at or approaching
      saturation.
 
      As saturation is approached responsivity decreases, and signal
      becomes nonlinear with brightness for small sources. Saturation can
      be exceeded for very bright or large sources once pixel
      antiblooming is overwhelmed. The raw 12-bit DN level indicative of the
      onset of saturation varies between the two CCDs. In the WAC
      (MESS:IMAGER=0) it is approximately 3600; in the NAC
      (MESS:IMAGER=1) it is approximately 3400. If a LUT has been used
      to convert 12-bit to 8-bit DN, then an 8-bit DN value of 255
      also indicates saturation. An 8-bit 255 is encountered before
      saturation of the 12-bit DN in the case of LUT 1. In autoexposure
      mode, the typical threshold for the allowable number of saturated
      pixels is 5 pixels. In manual exposure mode the number of saturated
      pixels is uncontrolled.
 
        1 = There are  &gt; 5 pixels exceeding the DN indicating onset
            of saturation.
        0 = There are  &lt; 5 pixels exceeding the DN indicating onset
            of saturation.
 
      Byte 3: Valid pivot position.
        1 = Pivot position not valid, as indicated by pivot position
            validity flag MESS:PIV_PV=0=invalid.
        0 = Pivot position valid as indicated by MESS:PIV_PV=1=valid.
 
      Byte 4: Filter wheel in position (WAC only; requires
      MESS:IMAGER=0, or else value of this byte = 0).
        1 = Filter wheel not in position, as indicated by either of
            two conditions:
            (a) filter wheel position validity flag MESS:FW_PV=0=invalid,
            (b) an excessive difference between filter wheel resolver
                goal and actual position as given in table below.
        0 = Filter wheel in position as indicated by an allowable
            difference between goal and position, and by MESS:FW_PV=1.
 
            Filter wheel encoder positions
            FILTER_NUMBER   MESS:FW_GOAL   Allowable (abs(MESS:FW_POS -
                                           MESS:FW_GOAL))
            1               17376          +/- 500
            2               11976          +/- 500
            3               6492           +/- 500
            4               1108           +/- 500
            5               61104          +/- 500
            6               55684          +/- 500
            7               50148          +/- 500
            8               44760          +/- 500
            9               39256          +/- 500
            10              33796          +/- 500
            11              28252          +/- 500
            12              22852          +/- 500
 
      Byte 5: Quality of spacecraft attitude knowledge.
        1 = Spacecraft attitude knowledge is bad (MESS:ATT_FLAG is in
            the range 0-3).
        0 = Spacecraft attitude knowledge is good (MESS:ATT_FLAG is in
            the range 5-7).
 
      Byte 6: CCD temperature range.
        1 = CCD out of temperature range at which performance is well
            calibrated (MESS:CCD_TEMP is outside a range of between
            1005 and 1130, which for the WAC is -45C to -11 C, and for
            the NAC is -48C to -14C).
        0 = CCD within well calibrated temperature range (MESS:CCD_TEMP
            is within the stated range).
 
      Byte 7: Completeness of data within the commanded selection of
      subframes or full frame. Missing frames or portions of frames are
      indicated in an EDR with a value of 0 (this cannot be a valid data
      value).
        1 = There are missing data (some pixels populated with 0).
        0 = There are no missing data.
 
      Bytes 8-15: spare.
 
      In addition, the following caveats are applicable to radiances and
      map-projected products derived from the EDRs.
 
      (1) WAC CLEAR FILTER. Filter 2 on the wide-angle camera is broad-
      band and designed for star imaging. Even extremely short exposure
      times saturate on Mercury or other typical extended sources.
      Flat-field and responsivity corrections for WAC filter 2
      are less accurate than in other filters.
 
      (2) NAC PSF. Due to mass constraints, the NAC aperture is smaller
      than what is required for diffraction-limited performance. The
      expected size of the Airy disk (approximately, the full-width at
      half-maximum of the point-spread function including only effects of
      diffraction) is &gt; 2 pixels. In practice the PSF is further
      broadened by surface imperfections of optical elements and scatter
      centers on optical surfaces.
 
      (3) COMPRESSION ARTIFACTS. Wavelet compression applied to science
      images is lossy. At higher compression ratios, compression artifacts
      will degrade data precision over spatial scales comparable to or
      smaller than several pixels. The degradation can be greater
      proportionally to the image dynamic range of brightness, if the data
      are converted from 12 to 8 bits in such a way that a 1 DN error
      occupies a greater fraction of the digital dynamic range. Wavelet
      compression was used minimally prior to Mercury orbit. The initial
      configuration in Mercury orbit was to perform 12 to 8 bit conversion
      using LUT0 for the WAC and LUT2 for the NAC, with a wavelet
      compression ratio usually set to 4:1 for color, 8:1 for monochrome
      imaging, or lossless for star imaging. Initial images
      exhibited unexpectedly visible compression artifacts. Beginning
      19 April 2011, LUT0 and LUT2 were replaced with LUT1 which better
      preserves image dynamic range. Beginning 19 May 2011, targeted color
      images began to be acquired with lossless compression. Beginning
      31 May 2011, the wavelet compression ratio for color images was
      reduced to 3:1 for global mapping. Wavelet compression is bypassed
      for a variety of types of images depending on downlink bandwidth and
      availability of space on the spacecraft solid-state recorder.
 
      (4) FRAME TRANSFER SMEAR. At very short exposure times (&lt;7 ms), the
      time for frame transfer is close to the total exposure so that the
      correction for frame transfer smear may leave perceptible
      artifacts. In October 2011 it was discovered that a software
      error in the image calibration pipeline leads to small filter- and
      exposure time-dependent systematic errors in correction of
      frame transfer smear. These are corrected beginning with version 4
      CDRs.
 
      (5) TIME VARIATIONS IN MDIS ATTITUDE. The orientation of MDIS
      relative to the spacecraft reference frame was determined inflight
      using star calibrations to solve for WAC-NAC coalignment, the
      orientation of the pivot plane, and the origin of the reported
      pivot position within the plane. However these alignments can be
      affected by thermal state of the spacecraft, or by any other
      events that potentially shift the position of the MDIS base
      relative to the spacecraft star cameras that generate the attitude
      measurements. Mercury and Venus flybys are thermally benign.
      However in Mercury orbit there are thermal perturbations from which
      errors in reported MDIS attitude of up to 350 microradians might be
      expected. Regular star calibrations are conducted in orbit and
      indicate up to two or more types of time variation in attitude of an
      image relative to a given reproted pivot position: (a) A small number
      of abrupt shifts of WAC and NAC image alignment, near the time of
      Mercury orbit insertion and again in July 2012, several hundred
      microradians in magnitude. The first is being addressed in an updated
      frames kernel, and was first describe in a frames kernel released in
      conjunction with release 9. The frames kernel in conjunction with
      release 11 and the first release of DDRs also includes the shift of
      NAC image alignment near the time of orbit insertion.
      (b) In addition to abrupt shifts of WAC and NAC image orientation,
      subsequent gradual drift is observed in both from star calibration
      images. That shift and the abrupt one in July 2012 are addressed by
      modifications to the pivot C kernel that incorporate drift
      as part of the pivot attitude. Limited star calibrations that
      determine the relative alignments of the WAC and NAC during the
      orbital phase of the mission indicate that the two fields of view
      drift together, so a single modified pivot C kernel
      is used to describe the pointing for both cameras.
 
      (6) ARTIFACTS IN GROUND-DERIVED FLAT-FIELD CORRECTIONS.
      Two factors make the ground-derived flat-fields less than ideal.
      First, MDIS&apos;s structure generated reflections so that in
      the calibration chamber, the illuminated source created glint off
      MDIS blanketing that reflected off the chamber window, adding
      spatially non-uniform stray light to the measurements.
      Eliminating the backscattering off the chamber window required
      acquisition of flat-fields at ambient (room-temperature) conditions
      at which residuals from the dark current correction introduce
      artifacts. Ultimately the latter approach was chosen for ground
      derivations. Second, there are dust donuts (shadows behind out-
      of-focus dust on the CCD cover glass) in the WAC. The locations of
      some WAC dust donuts moved during launch, and other dust donuts
      disappeared. Application of the ground-derived flat-fields
      systematically under- or over-corrects the non-identical WAC dust
      donuts.
 
      The flat-fields were rederived inflight using images of the onboard
      calibration target, and validated with bland areas of Venus during
      Venus flyby 2. These images were taken with a cold CCD, eliminating
      residuals from dark current, and are thought to have WAC dust
      donuts in their &apos;final&apos; post-launch position. The onboard target
      is uniform, but at the several-percent level shows evidence for low
      spatial frequency glint off the MDIS structure. Therefore to
      rederive the flat field for each WAC filter, an average of several
      images of the calibration target was divided by a median-filtered
      version of the same image, and multiplied by a median-filtered
      ground-derived flat field taken through the same filter with
      the same instrument binning. For the NAC the same procedure was
      used, with the inputs being Venus images.
 
      The following regions of different flat-fields were initially subject
      to errors tracing back to the ground calibration. In calibrated images,
      too-high values of the flat fields yielded too-low values of
      radiance or I/F, or vice versa. The most significant issues were in
      the upper rows of WAC filters 3 and 6.
 
        WAC filter 2: Flat-field values are place-holders only.
 
        WAC not-binned, all filters: In the last 25 columns on the right,
        values that are too high by 1-2%.
 
        WAC not-binned, filter 3: In the top 32 rows, long
        spatial frequency errors of up to a few percent, increasing to
        the top of the image.
 
        WAC not-binned, filter 6: In the top 145 rows, long
        spatial frequency errors of up to a few percent, increasing to
        the top of the image.
 
        WAC binned, all filters: In the last 15 columns on the right,
        values that are too high by 1-2%.
 
        WAC binned, filter 6: In the top 24 rows, long spatial
        frequency errors of up to a few percent, increasing to the top
        of the image.
 
        WAC, filter 5: A weak horizontal banding in the flat-field
        image probably originating from ground calibration.
 
        NAC binned: The most recent flat-field is ground-derived and
        flight measurements do not yield any improvement.
 
      For WAC filters 3 and 6 only, the flat-fields were updated one more
      time in Mercury orbit, to version 5. Approximately 400 images in
      each filter and with DPU binning on and off (4 data sets) were
      calibrated using the previous flat field version, and
      photometrically corrected to remove cross-scene illumination
      gradients. To produce updated flat-fields, the median of the 400
      images was scaled to unity over the same central region as with
      ground-derived flat-fields.
 
      A final update to version 6 in the end-of-mission delivery 15
      used a similar procedure, but more images for improved
      statistics, and excluded images with compression artifacts.
      An improved photometric correction reduced low spatial frequency
      errors. The following filter and binning combinations were
      upgraded to version 6: WAC filters 3 and 6, and binned images
      in WAC filters 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12.
 
      (7) RADIOMETRIC ACCURACY. The responsivities used to convert DNs
      to radiance are based on ground calibrations that were validated
      by comparison of MDIS with MASCS-VIRS measurements of Venus and
      Mercury. Except for 3 of the 12 filters, WAC radiances based on
      ground calibrations yielded a similar spectral shape with
      a 10-15% difference in absolute value. Filters 3 and 6 (at 480
      and 433 nm) were systematically too low and too high
      respectively, so the responsivites used to calibrate them were
      adjusted empirically to improve correspondence with MASCS-VIRS.
      In addition WAC filter 2 (clear filter) radiances have not been
      validated. The relative accuracy of NAC and WAC filter 7 data
      (which correspond in central wavelength) were examined by
      comparing nearly simultaneous images taken during the Mercury 2
      flyby and the NAC calibration was adjusted empirically to
      produce agreement.
 
      Both the NAC and WAC have CCDs whose responsivity to different
      wavelengths of light varies with CCD temperature. Inflight
      including Mercury orbit the CCD operating temperature range is
      typically -10C to -45C; however ground calibration
      measurements were acquired only at +23C, -31C, and -34C
      rendering the initial characterization of the temperature
      dependence inaccurate especially below -34C. M1 and M2
      measurements of comparable surfaces, acquired at CCD
      temperatures of -34C to -43C, were used to improve the
      calibration of CCD temperature dependence over the lower
      end of the temperature range, and this correction was applied
      to version 3 CDRs.
 
      In version 4 CDRs, an additional update to responsivity
      improved temperature dependence over the full operating range.
      The correction was derived empirically by fitting as a function
      of CCD temperature the median values of images acquired at a
      wide range of temperatures but a narrow range of photometric
      geometries.
 
      In version 5 CDRs, a similar correction to responsivity used
      all Mercury images satisfying the illumination criteria.
 
      (8) SCATTERED LIGHT. In the NAC, scattered light from out-of-field
      sources is an issue. The geometry contributing most of the scatter
      is 1-2 fields-of-view sunward of the NAC boresight. For a very
      large, evenly illuminated source that overfills the field-of-view
      by a factor of several, ray-trace studies supported by testing
      during Venus flyby 2 suggest that 2-7% of the radiance measured in
      the field-of-view will have come from out-of-field sources. The
      spatial pattern of the scatter is variable, due to diffuse
      reflections off the internal instrument housing.
 
      The WAC is subject to scattered light originating from within the
      field-of-view or just outside it. In overexposed images, the source
      is evidently multiple reflections off of 13 optical surfaces (2
      sides of each of 4 lenses, the spectral filter, and the CCD cover
      glass, as well as the CCD surface itself). The scatter becomes
      worse at longer wavelengths. Just off the limb of a large
      extended source near 1 field-of-view in size, like Venus or
      Mercury, measured radiance increases with wavelength from 2% to 7%
      of the value measured on the extended source. The value decreases
      with distance off the target more quickly at longer than at
      shorter wavelengths, but remains at 1% hundreds of pixels from
      the source. Conversely, light must be scattering from bright
      parts of an image to dark parts of an image. Averaged over
      sources tens of pixels in area, and away from abrupt brightness
      contrasts, scattered light affects shapes of spectra measured
      from WAC data at least at the 1-2% level, worse near brightness
      boundaries or for small, bright crater ejecta. The expected effect
      is enhanced brightness at &gt;650 nm in dark areas, and decreased
      brightness at &gt;650 nm in small bright areas.
 
      In the end-of-mission delivery 15, a forward model of the
      expected WAC scatter from a given scene was derived using
      optical design software modeling CCD structure and hardware,
      with magnitudes of scatter calibrated against flight measurements.
      The ray trace analysis reveal an in-scene component from light
      diffracted by the CCD and reflected by the CCD cover glass, and
      an out-of-scene component from light reflected off metallic
      surfaces alongside the CCD and back off the cover glass.
      CDRs with bright craters and other albedo non-uniformities located
      at geometries with the strongest scatter were identified, and
      excluded from the final version of color map products (MDRs,
      MD3s, and MP5s).
 
      (9) POINTING UNCERTAINTY. MDIS pivot C-kernels generated prior
      to September 2009 were based on counting steps of the pivot motor.
      There is periodicity at the scale of 3 degrees of pivot rotation
      in the relationship between pivot step size and physical angle,
      leading to reported pivot geometries being in error by up to 350
      microradians in early versions of the pivot C kernel. Inflight
      tests during 2009 supported development of an alternative
      calculation of pivot angle using the pivot position resolver;
      this approach is included in MDIS pivot C kernels since MDIS
      release 5 (images through Mercury flyby 3). The uncertainties
      in pivot attitude in latter kernels are of the order of
      35 microradians.
 
      Uncertainty in spacecraft pointing is by requirement less than 350
      microradians, but unofficial estimates from the guidance and
      control team suggest a more typical value near 70 microradians.
      When convolved with error in pivot pointing, this results in the
      majority of error in knowledge of image pointing (exclusive of
      thermal distortion or time variations that can be calibrated out).
 
      An additional and generally larger source of error in map
      projection of MDIS images acquired during Mercury orbit may be
      uncertainty in spacecraft position. At low altitudes that source
      of error dominates, whereas at high altitudes pointing error
      dominates, such that in either case typical errors in map
      projection from the best reconstructed spacecraft position are
      expected to be smaller than 1 km.
 
      In the end-of-mission delivery 15 of SPICE files and map products,
      these errors are reduced by controlling images using c-smithed
      kernels and a global digital elevation model (DEM), both
      derived using a least-squares bundle adjustment of common
      features, measured as tie point coordinates in overlapping NAC and
      WAC-G filter images of Mercury at favorable solar incidence and
      emission angles.
 
      (10) OUT OF FOCUS PARTICULATES IN LONG-EXPOSURE IMAGES OF DEEP
      SPACE. A number of images collected by the MDIS wide-angle camera
      using long (longer than 5 s) exposure times contain artifacts that
      are most likely caused by glint from microscopic particles that
      are in close proximity to the spacecraft. Because the particles
      are out of focus they appear as extended sources. The length of
      these artifacts is most likely due to motion of the particles
      over the significantly large exposure time of the images.
 
      (11) ANOTHER FLAT-FIELD ARTIFACT. In Mercury orbit, it was
      discovered that the flat-field correction in the image column
      immediately adjacent to the 4 column wide dark strip at the edge
      of the CCD is made problematic by low raw DN levels. Therefore
      beginning with version 3 CDRs, in not-binned 1024x1024 pixel
      images, during the calibration process the leftmost 5 columns are
      assigned null values; in 512x512 binned images the leftmost 3
      columns are assigned null values; and in 256x256 binned images
      the leftmost 2 columns are assigned null values.
 
      (12) TIME-VARIABLE WAC RESPONSIVITY. During Mercury orbit it was
      recognized that filter-dependent changes in WAC responsivity on
      the order of +/- 15% occurred over timescales as short as several
      days. Because those variations were not consistent from filter to
      filter, they led to spurious spectral features, which were
      particularly conspicuous near 750 nm. The cause(s) of these
      variations in responsivity are not known, but they could include
      transient radiation effects on the detector or electronics, aging
      of filters, periodic deposition and burn-off of contaminants on
      filters, or incorrect recording of exposure time. An initial
      empirical correction for images acquired in the first year of
      operations was developed at utilized in version 4 calibration.
 
      For version 5 calibration at end of mission, an
      updated correction covers the full duration of the orbital
      phase. Overlaps between color image sets in color mapping campaigns
      were used to derive a multiplicative correction factor for each
      filter and for each Earth day (2-3 orbits). It used all image data
      with a pixel scale &gt;50 m and incidence angle (measured at the
      center pixel of the 750-nm image in the image set) of &lt;80 degrees.
      The images were calibrated to I/F using the standard calibration
      with Correct(f,MET) set to unity, the latest
      version of temperature-dependence of detector responsivity, the
      latest correction for frame-transfer smear, and newly derived
      flat-field corrections. Images were then photometrically
      normalized to 30 degrees incidence angle, 0 degrees emission angle,
      and 30 degrees phase angle. Any portions of image sets lacking
      coverage in all filters, or with incidence angles &gt;70 degrees or
      emission angles &gt;30 degrees, were trimmed. Image sets were mapped
      to an equal-area (sinusoidal) projection at 4 km/pixel. All images
      acquired on each day were mosaicked for each filter, typically
      resulting in a fairly narrow north-south strip that had substantial
      overlap with surrounding days. With this dataset, multiplicative
      correction factors for each day were calculated through a weighted
      least-squares optimization that minimized the discrepancy between
      the median values for all spatial overlaps. The optimization was
      performed in two steps. First, a mosaic of data acquired before
      22 May 2011 was held as constant, because this dataset was seen to
      be largely self-consistent. However, these data covered only a
      fraction of the planet, so a mosaic with greater coverage was
      created from images that were corrected in the first iteration with
      low residual values. In the second step, all data were allowed to
      vary in the simultaneous optimization, with the new mosaic held as
      reference. Correction factors were derived for days on which no data
      were included in our optimization process by interpolating between
      adjacent days. Filters with center wavelengths at 700, 950, and
      1020 nm were not used for regional or global mapping and thus did not
      have enough overlap to derive correction factors with this method.
      Instead, their empirical correction was derived by comparing them
      with a synthetic global mosaic created by linear interpolation from
      images acquired with adjacent filters.
 
      An analysis of overlap among individual images shows
      that residual differences (which include errors from calibration,
      scattered light, and possible incomplete correction of photometric
      variation) average &lt;2% for the majority of the planet.
 
      (13) TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF WAC and NAC FOCAL LENGTH. The
      star calibrations used to track the position of the MDIS pivot
      base, augmented by special calibrations using fields with high
      spatial densities of stars, sample much of the range of thermal
      environments experienced in orbit. Analyses of these data showed
      that focal length of each camera is correlated with temperature
      of the focal plane housing &apos;FOCAL_PLANE_TEMPERATURE&apos;, and that
      focal length varies over the cameras&apos; operating temperature range
      by several parts in 10,000. This dependence is included in an
      updated delivery of the instrument kernel associated with PDS
      release 11.
