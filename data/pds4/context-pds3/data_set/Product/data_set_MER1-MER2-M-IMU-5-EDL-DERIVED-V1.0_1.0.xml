  Data Set Overview
  ==================
 
    This dataset consists of data products derived from data collected
    by Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) on the two Mars Exploration
    Rovers (MERs) during their entries into the martian atmosphere. The
    DATA/ directory contains one data file for each spacecraft (MER1.TAB
    and MER2.TAB). Each time file contains time ordered records of
    measured acceleration, derived velocity, derived position, derived
    atmospheric properties and other derived quantities.
 
    The MER-2 rover, which was launched on the MER-A mission to Gusev
    Crater on 10 June 2003, was later renamed Spirit. The MER-1 rover,
    which was launched on the MER-B mission to Meridiani Planum on 7
    July 2003, was later renamed Opportunity.

  Timing
  ======
 
    All data products in this dataset are derived from PDS volume
    MERIMU_1001 [KASSETAL2004], which uses Spacecraft Clock Time
    (SCLK time) as its time reference. For consistency, all times in
    this dataset are also SCLK times.
 
  Coordinate Systems
  ==================
 
    All data products in this dataset are derived from 4 Hz backshell
    IMU measurements in DATA/XTRANSFORMED.TAB in PDS volume MERIMU_1001
    [KASSETAL2004], where X is either 1 or 2. These acceleration
    measurements are given in an XYZ cartesian frame fixed relative to
    the spacecraft. This spacecraft frame is neither inertial nor fixed
    relative to Mars. The spacecraft is axisymmetric about the Z axis.
 
    The axis to which axial and normal accelerations are referenced is
    defined in the data processing section of this file.
 
    Position, velocity and acceleration are given in an XYZ cartesian
    frame whose origin is at the center of mass of Mars. The +Z axis
    passes through the north pole and the +X axis passes through the
    equator at zero degrees east areocentric longitude at a specified
    time. The +Y axis completes a right-handed set. The specified time
    is SCLK_TIME = 128270000.000 for MER1 and
    SCLK_TIME = 126460000.000 for MER2. Position is also given as radial
    distance, areocentric latitude, and areocentric longitude. This
    is the standard spherical polar coordinate system found in
    mathematical textbooks. Longitude increases to the east. Altitude
    is defined as radial distance minus the radial distance from the
    center of mass of Mars to the relevant landing site. Altitude is
    not referenced to any equipotential surface.
 
  Data Processing
  ===============
 
    Data processing is also described in [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A] and
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B].
 
    Four data products from DATA/XTRANSFORMED.TAB in PDS volume
    MERIMU_1001 [KASSETAL2004], where X is either 1 or 2, were used:
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT, BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X,
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y and BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z. Data after
    backshell separation were discarded. Backshell separation occurred
    when the terminal descent radar indicated that the spacecraft was
    about 10 m above the ground. It is reasonable to assume that the
    position and velocity at landing are the same as the reconstructed
    position and velocity at backshell separation due to the magnitude
    of the errors in reconstructed position and velocity. This is
    relevant for the determination of the entry states.
 
    Backshell separation was identified as the time of the last
    non-zero value of BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X, BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y,
    or BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z. Some lines of data are duplicates (for
    example, SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128277624.125 for MER-1). The
    extra lines of data were discarded. The nominal sampling rate is 4
    Hz and times usually end on .125, .375, .625, or .875 seconds.
    However, some sections of the data have a higher sampling rate of
    8 Hz (for example, SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128278390.000 for
    MER-1). In order to ensure a uniform timestep, such sections were
    reduced to a 4 Hz sampling rate by discarding any lines of data
    where the time did not end .125, .375, .625, or .875 seconds.
 
    Two lines of data are missing from 1TRANSFORMED.TAB, corresponding
    to SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128278462.875 and
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128278463.125. Values of
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X, BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y and
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z at these times were replaced by linear
    interpolation using neighbouring data points. Two missing lines of
    data from 2TRANSFORMED.TAB, corresponding to
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=126462354.625 and
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=126462355.875, were replaced in the
    same way.
 
    Data prior to the time of atmospheric entry were discarded. At this
    stage in the processing, each data series begins at the time of
    atmospheric entry and ends at backshell separation, which occurs
    after parachute deployment. Some of the analysis described in
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B] used these data series,
    including the work on determining the entry states. The data
    products archived in this PDS volume were generated from truncated
    versions of these data series. Data after parachute deployment were
    discarded to form these truncated data series. These low-altitude
    data were discarded because the assumptions made about spacecraft
    attitude for the trajectory reconstruction are significantly less
    reliable after parachute deployment than before.
 
    The MER-1 data series from atmospheric entry to parachute
    deployment begins at SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128278194.625
    and ends at SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=128278444.625. The MER-2
    data series from atmospheric entry to parachute deployment begins
    at SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=126462085.625 and ends at
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT=126462336.375.
 
    SCLK_TIME equals the processed SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT
    values. AXIAL_ACCELERATION equals -1 times the processed
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z values. The factor of -1 was introduced
    for convenience. It ensures that AXIAL_ACCELERATION is positive,
    rather than negative, at peak aerodynamic deceleration.
    AXIAL_ACCELERATION can be positive, zero, or negative.
    NORMAL_ACCELERATION equals the square root of the sum of the
    squares of the processed BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X and
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y values. NORMAL_ACCELERATION can be positive or
    zero, but cannot be negative. 1-sigma uncertainties in these
    quantities are SIGMA_SCLK_TIME, SIGMA_AXIAL_ACCELERATION and
    SIGMA_NORMAL_ACCELERATION.
 
    Next, the trajectory was reconstructed. The total acceleration
    acting on the spacecraft is the sum of aerodynamic and
    gravitational accelerations. It is necessary to transform the
    aerodynamic accelerations from a frame defined with respect to
    the spacecraft to a frame defined with respect to Mars. It was
    assumed that the aerodynamic acceleration consists of
    AXIAL_ACCELERATION only, that the aerodynamic acceleration vector
    is parallel to the velocity of the spacecraft with respect to
    the atmosphere, and that the atmosphere rotates at the same
    angular velocity as the solid body of Mars. Winds are thus
    neglected. The spacecraft rotates about the axis of symmetry
    on a timescale that is short compared to the timescale for
    changes in accelerations normal to this axis. Therefore it is
    reasonable to neglect NORMAL_ACCELERATION in the trajectory
    reconstruction. The three components of the transformed
    AXIAL_ACCELERATION are X_ACCELERATION, Y_ACCELERATION and
    Z_ACCELERATION. 1-sigma uncertainties in these quantities
    are SIGMA_X_ACCELERATION, SIGMA_Y_ACCELERATION and
    SIGMA_Z_ACCELERATION.
 
    Gravitational accelerations were calculated as follows:
 
    g = grad(U)                                               (1)
 
    U = GM/r ( 1 + (Rref/r)^2 C20 P20(cos theta) )            (2)
 
    P20(x) = sqrt(5) 1/2 (3x^2 - 1)                           (3)
 
    where theta = colatitude
    GM = 4.282E14 m^3 s^(-2)
    Rref = 3394.2 km
    C20 = -8.5791E-4
    [TYLERETAL2000]
 
    Entry states were determined as discussed in [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A]
    and [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B].

    After the completion of this work, alternative entry states were
    determined independently using SPICE kernels archived elsewhere
    at the PDS. Software used in this independent determination is
    archived in the EXTRAS directory of this PDS volume as file
    meraltedlandtimes.pro. According to documentation associated with
    those SPICE kernels, the UTC times of entry for MER-1 and MER-2 were
    2004-01-25T04:48:41.720 and 2004-01-04T04:19:51.720, respectively.
 
    According to the SPICE kernels, the position and velocity of MER-1
    at the time of entry were:
    SCLK_TIME = 128278194.142 s
    RADIAL_DISTANCE = 3522201.3 m
    LATITUDE = -2.9091901 degrees
    LONGITUDE = 340.90205 degrees east
    Speed relative to Mars-centered inertial frame = 5698.6452 m/s
    Flight-path angle = 11.469960 degrees
    Flight-path azimuth = 86.503350 degrees
 
    According to the SPICE kernels, the position and velocity of MER-2
    at the time of entry were:
    SCLK_TIME = 126462085.048
    RADIAL_DISTANCE = 3522202.1 m
    LATITUDE = -17.749196 degrees
    LONGITUDE = 161.77632 degrees east
    Speed relative to Mars-centered inertial frame = 5627.5267 m/s
    Flight-path angle = 11.494375 degrees
    Flight-path azimuth = 79.025420 degrees
 
    These alternative entry states, which are very similar to those
    obtained by [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B], were not
    used to produce these datasets.
 
    After determination of the entry states, as described in
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B], the equations of
    motion were integrated forwards in time from the initial position
    and velocity using the total acceleration, which produced a time
    series of position and velocity (X_POSITION, Y_POSITION, Z_POSITION,
    RADIAL_DISTANCE, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, X_VELOCITY, Y_VELOCITY,
    Z_VELOCITY). This reconstructed trajectory extends from the time of
    atmospheric entry to parachute deployment.
 
    The derived velocity values are archived as X_VELOCITY,
    Y_VELOCITY and Z_VELOCITY. 1-sigma uncertainties in these
    quantities are SIGMA_X_VELOCITY, SIGMA_Y_VELOCITY and
    SIGMA_Z_VELOCITY. The derived position values are archived
    as X_POSITION, Y_POSITION and Z_POSITION. 1-sigma uncertainties
    in these quantities are SIGMA_X_POSITION, SIGMA_Y_POSITION and
    SIGMA_Z_POSITION. The derived position values are also archived in
    a spherical polar coordinate system as RADIAL_DISTANCE, LATITUDE
    and LONGITUDE. 1-sigma uncertainties in these quantities are
    SIGMA_RADIAL_DISTANCE, SIGMA_LATITUDE and SIGMA_LONGITUDE. The
    speed of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere, which is
    assumed to rotate with the same angular velocity as the solid
    body of Mars, is important for the atmospheric structure
    reconstruction. These values are archived as VREL and their
    1-sigma uncertainties are archived as SIGMA_VREL. Uncertainties
    were found using a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis.
 
    Atmospheric density is related to aerodynamic deceleration by
    the drag equation.
 
    m az = rho A vrel^2 CA / 2                                (4)
 
    where m is spacecraft mass
    az is AXIAL_ACCELERATION
    rho is atmospheric density
    A is the reference area of the spacecraft
    vrel is VREL, the speed of the spacecraft with respect to the
    atmosphere
    CA is the axial force coefficent, usually on the order of 2
 
    A for both Spirit and Opportunity was that of a disk of diameter
    2.648 m [SCHOENENBERETAL2005B]. m was 827.0 kg for Spirit and
    832.3 kg for Opportunity [DESAI&amp;KNOCKE2004].
 
    A similar equation relates NORMAL_ACCELERATION and the normal
    force coefficient CN, so
    CN/CA = NORMAL_ACCELERATION / AXIAL_ACCELERATION
 
    Atmospheric density can be derived from measured aerodynamic
    decelerations using the drag equation. However, this will not
    work at very high altitudes when densities and aerodynamic
    decelerations are very small. Acceleration measurements are
    dominated by errors and offsets at very high altitudes, implying
    unphysical negative densities. Also, this will not work at very
    low altitudes, after parachute deployment. The aerodynamic
    behavior of the parachute-backshell-lander system is very complex
    and it is not possible to determine CA accurately. Without an
    accurate CA, the drag equation cannot be used to determine
    atmospheric density from aerodynamic decelerations. So the
    atmospheric structure reconstruction cannot be performed over
    the entire trajectory.
 
    Atmospheric pressure is related to atmospheric density by the
    equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.
 
    dp/dr = rho x (gr + cr)                                   (5)
 
    where p is pressure
    r is radial distance
    gr, which is negative and a function of position, is the radial
    component of equation 1
    cr is the radial component of - Omegavec x (Omegavec x rvec)
    Omegavec is the angular vector for the rotation of Mars
    rvec is the spacecraft&apos;s position vector
 
    Atmospheric temperature is related to atmospheric pressure and
    density by the ideal gas law.
 
    mu p = rho R T / NA                                       (6)
 
    where mu is the mean molecular mass of the martian atmosphere
    (43.49 g/mol, [MAGALHAESETAL1999])
    R is the universal gas constant
    T is temperature
    NA is Avogadro&apos;s number
 
    If the appropriate value of CA can be determined at each timestep,
    then the atmospheric density can be found at each timestep using
    known quantities and equation 1. Next, atmospheric pressure can be
    found at each timestep using equation 5 if a boundary condition is
    specified. The commonly-accepted boundary condition is that
    p0 = rho0 g0 H0, where H is the measured density scale height at
    the top of the atmosphere and the subscript 0 refers to values at
    the top of the atmosphere. This can also be expressed as a
    temperature, T0 = mu g0 H0 / R. Once atmospheric pressure and
    atmospheric density are known, atmospheric temperature can then
    be found at each timestep using equation 6.
 
    Two atmospheric structure reconstructions were performed for each
    spacecraft. One considered uncertainties, began at about 100 km
    altitude and ended at parachute deployment. The other did not
    consider uncertainties, began at about 120 km altitude and ended
    at parachute deployment. The reasons for this are related to the
    Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis and will be described shortly.
    The atmospheric structure reconstruction that did not consider
    uncertainties was performed first and is described next.
 
    The MER-1 atmospheric structure reconstruction that did not
    consider uncertainties used data between 128278199.625 and
    128278444.625 seconds, inclusive. The MER-2 atmospheric structure
    reconstruction that did not consider uncertainties used data
    between 126462095.625 and 126462336.375 seconds, inclusive.
 
    CA is a function of attitude, spacecraft shape, atmospheric
    density, and speed of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere.
    Since the MER entry capsule is axisymmetric, the dependence on
    attitude can be expressed in terms of the angle of attack, alpha,
    which is the angle between the symmetry axis and the velocity of
    the spacecraft with respect to the atmosphere. Alpha is small,
    usually less than 5 degrees. MER project engineers estimated the
    likely entry trajectory and atmospheric structure before entry
    occurred. They used numerical simulations to determine CA as a
    function of alpha, or CA(alpha), and CN as a function of alpha, or
    CN(alpha), at a finite number of points along this trajectory.
    This set of simulated coefficients is called the aerodynamic
    database. Values of CA(alpha) and CN(alpha) between the simulated
    points can be found by interpolation. Interpolation required the
    velocity of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere, the Mach
    number and the Knudsen number.
 
    Ma = vrel / sqrt( gamma p / rho )                         (7)
 
    Kn = 1 / ( sqrt(2) pi d^2 n D )                           (8)
 
    where Ma is Mach number
    Kn is Knudsen number
    vrel is VREL, the speed of the spacecraft with respect to the
    atmosphere
    gamma is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure to the
    heat capacity at constant volume of the martian atmosphere
    pi is 3.14...
    d is the diameter of an atmospheric molecule
    n, which satisfies n = NA rho / mu, is the atmospheric number density
    D, which satisfies pi D^2/4 = A, is the reference diameter of
    the spacecraft
 
    Values corresponding to pure CO2 were used for gamma and d, so
    gamma = 1.4 [ATKINS2002] and d = 4.46E-10 m [SCHOENENBERETAL2005B].
    The aerodynamic database has been published in graphical form in
    [SCHOENENBERETAL2005B]. Several different flight regimes are
    encompassed by the aerodynamic database: free molecular flow,
    transitional flow, hypersonic continuum flow, and supersonic
    continuum flow.
 
    Although the aerodynamic database has been published in graphical
    format in [SCHOENENBERETAL2005B], it is not yet possible for
    it to be published in tabular format (personal communication,
    Desai, 2008).
 
    First, preliminary profiles of atmospheric density, pressure,
    and temperature were obtained using CA=2. As outlined in
    [WITHERSETAL2003B, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B],
    an iterative procedure was used to determine rho, alpha, CA and
    CN at each timestep. Results for alpha are unreliable when the
    ratio NORMAL_ACCELERATION / AXIAL_ACCELERATION is inaccurate,
    which occurs at high altitudes. Alpha and CN were set equal to zero
    for times before 128278242.125 s (MER-1) or 126462133.125 s
    (MER-2) (about 80 km). Densities from the upper ten km of the
    profile were used to find H0 and to provide the upper boundary
    condition for the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. Pressures
    and temperatures were then obtained.
 
    The results of this atmospheric structure reconstruction are
    archived as CA, CN, ALPHA, MA, KN, RHO, PRESS and TEMP.
    Uncertainties were obtained using a Monte Carlo technique. The
    Monte Carlo technique generated an ensemble of values of
    AXIAL_ACCELERATION for each timestep using the quoted nominal
    values and their uncertainties. If values from near 120 km were
    used, then some of these accelerations were negative, which
    correspond to unphysical negative densities. In order to minimize
    the occurrence of negative densities, the atmospheric structure
    reconstruction that considered uncertainties began at about 100 km,
    not 120 km. The MER-1 atmospheric structure reconstruction that
    considered uncertainties used data between 128278219.625 and
    128278444.625 seconds, inclusive. The MER-2 atmospheric structure
    reconstruction that considered uncertainties used data between
    126462110.625 and 126462336.375 seconds, inclusive. An ensemble of
    values for T0 was used as the upper boundary condition in the
    equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. This ensemble was generated
    using the value of T0 from the atmospheric structure reconstruction
    without uncertainties (160 K for both MER-1 and MER-2) and an
    assumed uncertainty of 50 K. Atmospheric structure reconstructions
    were performed as above using these ensemble inputs. Their standard
    deviations were used to generate uncertainties for the archived
    data products. This is an abbreviated description of the error
    analysis, see [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B] for further information.
 
    Derived values of atmospheric density, atmospheric pressure,
    and atmospheric temperature are archived as RHO, PRESS and TEMP,
    respectively. 1-sigma uncertainties in these quantities are
    archived as SIGMA_RHO, SIGMA_PRESS and SIGMA_TEMP. Derived values
    of CA, CN, alpha, Ma, and Kn are archived as CA, CN, ALPHA,
    MA and KN, respectively. 1-sigma uncertainties in these quantities
    are archived as SIGMA_CA, SIGMA_CN, SIGMA_ALPHA, SIGMA_MA and
    SIGMA_KN.
 
    Each run of a Monte Carlo error analysis leads to slightly
    different uncertainties. Different runs were used to generate
    the data products archived here and the data products published
    as supplemental information to [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A]. The Monte
    Carlo techniques were only used to generate those data products
    whose names begin with &apos;SIGMA_&apos;. Data products such as LATITUDE and
    RHO were produced without consideration of uncertainties, so they
    do not change from one run of the data processing software to the
    next.
 
    Not all data products are defined at all timesteps. Data
    products derived in the atmospheric structure reconstruction are
    not defined above about 120 km and uncertainties in these data
    products are not defined above about 100 km. Uncertainties in
    alpha and CN are also not defined above about 80 km, where alpha
    and CN are assumed to be zero. Such data products are given the
    null value -1 in the data files.

  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
 
    Data coverage is excellent. The only minor gaps in the data
    series are discussed above. None of the values of
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT, BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X,
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y and BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z were identified
    as erroneous. Uncertainties in the values of
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_X, BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Y,
    BACKSHELL_IMU_ACCEL_Z and other IMU measurements from PDS
    volume MERIMU_1001 [KASSETAL2004] are discussed in
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B].
 
  Limitations and Caveats
  =======================
 
    The entry states used to generate this archived data volume are
    not as accurate as they could be. They were determined as
    described in [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B],
    rather than being taken from SPICE kernels. Uncertainties in the
    entry state were assumed to be the same as for Mars Pathfinder
    [MAGALHAESETAL1999]. There is no evidence to support this
    assumption. The PDS volume MERIMU_1001 [KASSETAL2004] contains
    information on spacecraft attitude during entry. This
    reconstruction does not use that information and instead made
    several assumptions concerning spacecraft attitude. Use of the
    archived attitude quaternions led to a realistic reconstructed
    trajectory for Spirit, but not Opportunity
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B]. These attitude
    quaternions were derived from angular rate data recorded by
    gyroscopes and an initial attitude. It is possible that the
    initial attitude for Opportunity, but not Spirit, was unreliable,
    thereby contaminating the entire time series of attitude
    quaternions. The archived angular rate data from the gyroscopes
    are useless, because the orientation of the gyroscope axes with
    respect to the spacecraft coordinate frame has not been
    published [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B].
 
    If the trajectory and atmospheric structure are reconstructed
    using the alternative (SPICE) entry states, rather than the
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A] entry states, changes are small. In this
    discussion, the &apos;difference&apos; in a reconstructed quantity is
    the value of that quantity for the reconstruction that used the
    alternative (SPICE) entry state minus the value of that quantity
    for the reconstruction that used the [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A] entry
    state. The &apos;relative difference&apos; is the ratio of the &apos;difference&apos;
    to the value of that quantity for the reconstruction that used the
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A] entry state. For MER-1, the difference in
    altitude, which is about +1 m at entry and +450 m at parachute
    deployment, varies approximately linearly with altitude. The
    difference in latitude is -0.01 degrees. The difference in
    longitude is +0.02 degrees at entry and -0.04 degrees at parachute
    deployment. It varies approximately linearly with time. The
    difference in speed of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere
    is -1.38 m/s at entry and -1.74 m/s at parachute deployment. The
    relative difference in density is less than 0.1% above 30 km
    and less than 1% at all altitudes. The relative difference in
    pressure is less than 0.5% at all altitudes. The difference in
    temperature varies smoothly between -0.5 K at 80 km and -1.5 K at
    parachute deployment. For MER-2, the difference in altitude, which
    is about +2 m at entry and +100 m at parachute deployment, varies
    approximately linearly with altitude. The difference in latitude
    is -0.05 degrees. The difference in longitude is -0.02 degrees
    at entry and -0.03 degrees at parachute deployment. The difference
    in speed of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere is between
    -2.25 m/s and -2.45 m/s. The relative difference in density is less
    than 0.1% above 50 km and less than 1.2% at all altitudes. The
    relative difference in pressure is less than 0.5% at all altitudes
    below 110 km. The difference in temperature is between 0 K and
    -0.2 K at all altitudes between 30 km and 110 km. The difference
    in temperature is between -0.2 K and -1.5 K at all altitudes
    between 30 km and parachute deployment. The alternative (SPICE)
    entry states occur about 0.5 s before the [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A]
    entry states. This was neglected in the comparison.
 
    There is an inconsistency between the trajectory reconstruction
    and the atmospheric structure reconstruction. The trajectory
    reconstruction assumes an angle of attack of zero and neglects
    normal accelerations. The atmospheric structure reconstruction
    determines the value of the angle of attack, which was typically
    on the order of a few degrees. If the angle of attack is fixed
    at 0 degrees or at 2 degrees in both the trajectory reconstruction
    and the atmospheric structure reconstruction, then changes in the
    inferred trajectory and atmospheric structure are generally small.
    The changes in density and temperature at parachute deployment
    are &lt;2% and &lt;3K. However, if the angle of attack is fixed at 5
    degrees, then the density and temperature at 30 km change by
    &lt;1% and &lt;3K, whereas the density, temperature, altitude, and
    atmosphere-relative speed at parachute deployment change by 7%,
    about 20 K, 0.2 km, and 20 m/s. These changes are similar for
    both Spirit and Opportunity.
 
    Wind speeds were assumed to be zero in the trajectory
    reconstruction and the atmospheric structure reconstruction.
    Since neither the mean nor the standard deviation of the zonal
    and meridional wind speeds for the entries of Spirit and
    Opportunity were known as functions of altitude, non-zero
    wind speeds were not considered in the trajectory and
    atmospheric structure Monte Carlo error analysis.
    If the zonal wind is fixed at +30 m/s eastward throughout the
    atmosphere, then the density and temperature at 30 km change
    by +2% and -2K. The density, temperature, altitude, and
    atmosphere-relative speed at parachute deployment change
    by +15%, -20K, +0.4 km, and -30 m/s. If the wind direction
    is reversed, then the sign of these changes is also reversed.
    These changes are similar for both Spirit and Opportunity.
 
    Three parts of the entry state were determined indirectly in
    [WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006A, WITHERS&amp;SMITH2006B]: flight path azimuth,
    latitude, and longitude. Changes in latitude and longitude at
    entry by approximately 1 degree merely translate the entire
    trajectory horizontally, with negligible change in the inferred
    atmospheric structure. Changes in the flight path angle at entry
    by approximately 5 degrees change the latitude at 30 km and
    parachute deployment by approximately 1 degree; changes in
    longitude are much smaller. Changes in the inferred atmospheric
    structure at 30 km are negligible, but changes in density and
    temperature at parachute deployment are 2% and 3K. These changes
    are similar for both Spirit and Opportunity.
 
    The IMU data archived in PDS volume MERIMU_1001 [KASSETAL2004]
    are stated in that volume&apos;s DATASET.CAT file to be those
    transmitted from the spacecraft. That is, they have not undergone
    additional calibration. Recalibration of the MER IMU data began in
    2004 and so these data should be considered preliminary (Desai,
    personal communication, 2004). At the time of writing, January
    2008, that work is ongoing (Desai, personal communication, 2008).
    These recalibrated data will be delivered to the PDS in 2008
    (Desai, personal communication, 2008). The reconstructed
    trajectory and atmospheric structure archived here and based
    on preliminary IMU data may in the future be superceded by
    reconstructions based on the more accurate recalibrated IMU data.
