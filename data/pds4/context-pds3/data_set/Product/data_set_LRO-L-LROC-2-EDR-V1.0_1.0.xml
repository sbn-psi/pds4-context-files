            This data set comprises Un-calibrated data from the LROC NAC and
            WAC cameras. The science data is comprised of Un-calibrated raw
            images, along with pointing data and housekeeping information.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
    The LRO Camera consists of two Narrow Angle Cameras (NACs) that provide
    0.5 meter-scale panchromatic images over a combined 5 km swath, a Wide
    Angle Camera (WAC) to provide images at a scale of 100 meters/pixel in
    seven color bands over a 60 km swath, (during the nominal 50 km primary
    mission phase) and a Sequence and Compressor System (SCS) supporting data
    acquisition for both cameras. LROC is a modified version of the Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiters ConTeXt Camera (CTX) and MARs Color Imager
    (MARCI), built by Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) in San Diego, CA.
 
    The two NAC, WAC and SCS are located on the LRO Instrument bench, with
    NAC/WAC respective boresights aligned with the nadir (+Z) axis of the
    spacecraft. The SCS communicates with the LRO spacecraft over a high-speed
    SpaceWire interface, which provide both command and data communication
    pathways. LROC observations are stored on a solid state recorder (SSR)
    partition. Observations are downlinked to the ground using a Ka-band
    receiver, located at White Sands New Mexico, and processed by the MOC
    before being sent to the LROC Science Operations Center for processing
    into PDS EDR and CDR products.
 
    Each NAC CCD, when it has completed an image integration, has the even and
    odd pixels read out through separate electronics, after which the data is
    companded from 12bit to 8bit, and finally losslessly compressed before
    being written to the spacecraft data recorder. On the ground processing by
    the LROC SOC uncompresses the data and then interleaves the pixels to
    produce the NAC EDR file. The label is populated with information obtained
    from the original image command, spacecraft housekeeping, and other
    computed values. No further processing is performed on the data at this
    stage.
 
    The WAC CCD band passes are read out by the electronics, companded from
    12bit to 8bit, and the losslessly compressed before being written to the
    spacecraft data recorder in real-time. For both monochrome and multi-
    spectral observations, frames (which consist of the VIS/UV bands commanded
    for the observation) are stored in a single band format. On the ground
    processing by the LROC SOC uncompresses the data to produce the WAC EDR
    file. The label is populated with information obtained from the original
    image command, spacecraft housekeeping, and other computed values. No
    further processing is performed.
 
    This data release contains portions of the LROC Experiment Data Record
    (EDR) Archive, a collection of image data taken with the LROC instrument
    suite. A data release will contain both NAC and WAC EDR files from
    multiple days and multiple orbits.
 
    This data release also contains ancillary data files: browse and thumbnail
    version of each observation; an index file (&apos;index.tab&apos;) that tabulates
    the contents of this data release; a cumulative index file
    (&apos;cumindex.tab&apos;) that tabulates the entire contents of the data set; and
    documentation files describing the data products, archive volume and
    calibration.
 
    Processing
    ==========
    The LRO Mission Operations Center (MOC) pushes LROC science files (NAC and
    WAC observations), definitive SPICE kernels, LRO spacecraft and LROC
    instrument housekeeping and other ancillary files to the LROC SOC during
    the mission, on a daily basis. To process the NAC and WAC observations
    into PDS EDR products, the LROC SOC must ingest and process SPICE kernels
    and the housekeeping data to extract meta-data about each observation,
    including instrument temperatures and observation geometry on the lunar
    surface. Once the meta-data has been extracted and written into our
    database, the individual science files can then be processed into the
    respective EDR product.

    Geometric Accuracy
    ==================
    Latitude and longitude coordinates calculated for the images given in the
    index.tab file were computed using the best available spacecraft position
    and orientation information at the time of processing, provide by the LRO
    Project in the form of SPK and CK kernel files. While these kernels should
    be equivalent to those retrievable from the NAIF web site
    (http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov), there may be small discrepancies and the NAIF
    versions of the kernels are preferred for all further processing.
 
    Please refer to the white paper &apos;A Standardized Lunar Coordinate System
    for LRO&apos; for details on LRO project adopted lunar coordinate system, which
    were used during the calculation of latitude and longitude coordinates.
