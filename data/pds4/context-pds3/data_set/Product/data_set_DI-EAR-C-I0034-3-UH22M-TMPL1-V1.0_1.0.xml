  Data Set Overview
  =================
  This data set includes calibrated images of Deep Impact mission
  target comet 9P/Tempel 1 taken from November 1997 through July 1999
  using using the University of Hawaii, 2.24 meter telescope and a
  Tektronics 2048x2048 CCD.  Observations were made using the facility
  BVRI broadband filters.  This data set also includes tables of
  astrometric measurements of 9P/Tempel 1 for 1997 through 1999, as
  well as calibration frames taken from 1997 and into 2000.  This is
  an ongoing, cumulative data set; reduced images of 9P/Tempel 1
  images taken from 2000 through 2005 at the UH2.2m telescope are
  expected to be added in the future.

  Processing
  ==========
  All data reductions were performed using IRAF (the Image Reduction
  and Analysis Facility, Tody (1986) [TODY1986]).  Data have been
  flattened, bias subtracted, trimmed, overscan corrected and cleaned
  for cosmic rays.  Data were not reduced to an absolute flux
  calibration.
 
  On photometric nights, standard stars from Landolt were observed.
  Some of the nights were not photometric, and these images were
  calibrated using data taken on photometric nights.  This calibration
  utilized the measured relative brightnesses of a large number of
  field stars and the comet in each field.  The calibration was very
  accurate for extinctions as large as a delta magnitude of
  approximately 1.0.
 
 
  Data
  ====
  The data are separated into yearly directories, then into
  subdirectories corresponding to the each separate night of
  observing.  Within most of these daily subdirectories is:
 
    - A calibration image directory (/calib) which includes the bias
      frames and flat field frames used for reduction
    - A directory of standard star frames (/stands),
    - A directory of comet 9P/Tempel 1 images (/tempel1), and
    - In limited cases, a directory of field star frames of the
      location Tempel 1 during selected nights from 1997 through 1999
      (/di_calib); Used to calibrate data acquired on non-photometric
      nights
 
  The individual image names have the following format: YYMMDD_###.FIT
  where YYMMDD is the year, month and date of the observation and ###
  is the number of the image taken for that night.
 
  Included within the yearly directories for 1997, 1998, and 1999 is a
  table of astrometric measurements of 9P/Tempel 1.  Astrometric
  positions were obtained using the USNO-B1.0 reference catalog.
  The file names for these tables have the following format:
  ASTROMETRY_YYYY_MM.TAB where YYYY is the year and MM is the month.
  Each table has an entry for each Tempel 1 image for which astrometry
  could be computed.
 
 
  Image Orientation
  -----------------
  For images taken with this detector, the orientation was North down
  and East on the right for images older than 20 July 2003.  After 20
  July 2003, the orientation was North on the top and East on the
  left.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    These data were acquired as part of the ground-based observing
    campaign for the Deep Impact mission.  The science team used
    these data to supplement the light curve of 9P/Tempel 1 and
    to study the rotation state of the nucleus and the dust
    environment of the coma.
 
    This data set was peer reviewed on April 6, 2006 and accepted
    pending a few corrections and modifications, which have been
    applied.
