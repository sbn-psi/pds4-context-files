            This data set includes Galileo Orbiter SSI radiometrically
            calibrated images of the asteroid 951 Gaspra, created using ISIS
            software and assuming nadir pointing. This is an original
            delivery of radiometrically calibrated files, not an update to
            existing files. All images archived include the the asteroid
            within the image frame. Calibration was performed in 2013-2014.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
 
  This dataset includes the Galileo Orbiter Solid State Imaging
  data on the asteroid 951 Gaspra.  The raw data have already been archived in
  PDS with the data set name &apos;Galileo Imaging (SSI) Asteroid, Earth and Moon
  Experiment Data Records&apos; and can be found by searching on the data set
  identification &apos;GO-A/E-SSI-2-REDR-V1.0&apos;. Only those images in which Gaspra
  actually appears have been included here. Images in both FITS and ISIS Cube
  format are provided.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
 
  Preparation in IRAF
  -------------------
 
  The raw images were converted from VICAR format to FITS format using the
  image reduction package IRAF.  The image prefix tables, telemetry tables,
  and bad data value headers were removed from the raw images.  All relevant
  label keywords describing the image have been retained in the raw image
  labels.
 
  Processing in ISIS and preparation of ISIS cube versions
  --------------------------------------------------------
 
  The FITS images prepared as above in IRAF were converted from FITS format
  to ISIS cube format using GLLSSI2ISIS, and radiometrically calibrated using
  GLLSSICAL.  GLLSSICAL was the tool provided in the original, raw data
  delivery for calibration of Galileo SSI images.
 
   - GLLSSI2ISIS inputs were the raw image file name and the output image file
  name for the ISIS format image.
 
   - GLLSSICAL inputs were image file name in the ISIS format created by
  GLLSSI2ISIS, units = IOF, scale=1.
 
   - The GLLSSICAL output was the radiometrically calibrated image in ISIS
  cube format, which is archived in the data/qube directory of this data set.
 
  Preparation of the FITS versions
  --------------------------------
 
  The radiometrically calibrated ISIS cube format images were converted to
  FITS format using the ISIS routine ISIS2FITS.
 
   - ISIS2FITS inputs were the radiometrically calibrated image file name (in
  ISIS cube format), bittype=32, minpercent=0.5, maxpercent=99.5, info=Nominal
  (nominal fits header).
 
   - The ISIS2FITS output was the radiometrically calibrated image in
  FITS format, which is archived in the data/fits directory of this data set.

  Data
  ====
 
  The data are included in a series of files with filenames of the
  form *rcal_XXX.FIT, where * denotes the spacecraft cloak start count, rcal
  denotes the image has been radiometrically calibrated, and XXX denotes the
  filter name where:
 
            Filter Name       XXX
            CLEAR             clr
            RED               red
            GREEN             gre

            IR-8890           ir8
            IR-9680           ir9
 
  The filename of the original, raw files were the last four digits of the
  spacecraft clock start count.
 
  Filter response curves taken from Klaasen et al. 1997 are included in the
  document directory.
 
  The general table, color-set_id.tab, denotes which images were acquired at
  similar viewing conditions but in separate filters, thus constituting a
  color image set. The table includes image file named, filter name, and a
  designator for which color set the image belongs. Images with the same
  designator value (A-F) belong to the same color image set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    This dataset includes only those Galileo SSI images in which
    951 Gaspra actually appears. No viable camera kernels for the time frame
    in which the Gaspra images were acquired were included in the original PDS
    archive. These kernels are used by GLLSSICAL to convert raw values to
    reflectance. A work around was used in which GLLSSICAL was set to assume
    nadir pointing for all images. This produces negligible errors in
    radiometric values, but disables any calculations of viewing and
    illumination conditions.
 
    Several images include saturated lines (rows of pixels) and pixels. These
    were present in the original raw images and not removed in the radiometric
    calibration process.
