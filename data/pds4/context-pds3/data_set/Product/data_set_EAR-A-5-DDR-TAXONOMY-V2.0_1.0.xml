  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset provides taxonomic classifications of asteroids in each
    of four different systems: Tholen (1984, 1989) [THOLEN1984,
    THOLEN1989]; Barucci, et al. (1987) [BARUCCIETAL1987]; Tedesco, et al.
    (1989) [TEDESCOETAL1989]; and Howell, et al. (1994) [HOWELLETAL1994].
 
    Asteroid taxonomy is the grouping of asteroids into a small number of
    classes whose members have similar spectral reflectance properties.
    The classification efforts prior to 1990 utilized only the
    reflectivities between 0.3 and 1.1 microns and visual geometric
    albedos for this purpose (see Zellner et al. 1985 [ZELLNERETAL1985]
    and Tedesco 1989 [TEDESCO1989]); more recently, infrared data
    extending to 2.5 microns were used for a new classification scheme
    (Howell et al. 1994 [HOWELLETAL1994]).
 
    There are many different ways to perform this type of cluster
    analysis, and the four different classifications tabulated in this
    data set represent four different algorithms developed during the past
    two decades (Tholen 1984 [THOLEN1984], Barucci et al. 1987
    [BARUCCIETAL1987], Tedesco et al. 1989 [TEDESCOETAL1989], and Howell
    et al. 1994 [HOWELLETAL1994]), as well as an extension of one of these
    algorithms to additional objects (Tholen 1989 [THOLEN1989]).  These
    four taxonomies have effectively replaced the older schemes used
    previously.  Detailed descriptions of each method can be found in the
    corresponding references.
 
    In this particular data set, the four parameter fields indicate which
    parameters were used to arrive at the classification for the
    corresponding asteroid in each of the four taxonomies.  A number
    indicates the number of color indices utilized, the letter &apos;G&apos;
    indicates that a groundbased radiometric albedo was also utilized, and
    the letter &apos;I&apos; indicates that an IRAS radiometric albedo was
    utilized.  The letter &apos;S&apos; indicates that the classification is based
    on a medium resolution spectrum published by Chapman and Gaffey (1979)
    [CHAPMAN&amp;GAFFEY1979A].
 
    The Tholen (1984) [THOLEN1984] taxonomy used Eight-Color Asteroid
    Survey color  indices (Zellner et al. 1985 [ZELLNERETAL1985]),
    ground-based visual geometric albedos where available, and a minimal
    tree clustering algorithm. The Tholen (1989) [THOLEN1989] extension
    incorporated UBV color indices and some medium resolution
    spectrophotometry. The Barucci et al. (1987) [BARUCCIETAL1987]
    taxonomy also used Eight-Color data, but only those for which a
    complete set of seven color indices were available, IRAS visual
    geometric albedos, and a G-mode cluster analysis method. The Tedesco
    et al. (1989) [TEDESCOETAL1989] taxonomy used only the u-v and v-x
    color indices from the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey, mostly IRAS visual
    geometric albedos (but a few ground-based albedos for particularly
    interesting cases), and a stereoscopic viewing method for identifying
    clusters.  The Howell et al. (1994) [HOWELLETAL1994] taxonomy is based
    on a combination of Eight-Color and 52-color (Bell et al. 1988
    [BELLETAL1988]) data, resampled at 65 points to provide more uniform
    wavelength sampling, and a neural network cluster identification
    method, though in eight cases, a visual geometric albedo was used to
    distinguish between two or more possible classifications.
 
    The data set contains entries for 984 objects.  Each of the four
    taxonomies represented in this data set produced classifications for a
    subset of these 984 objects:
 
      Tholen (1984, 1989)      978 objects
      Barucci et al. (1987)    438 objects
      Tedesco et al. (1989)    357 objects
      Howell et al. (1994)     112 objects
 
    The six objects not classified by Tholen all have some spectral
    reflectance data available, but the data were deemed too noisy to
    produce a classification.  Their &apos;---&apos; entries in the classification
    table serve simply to call attention to the fact that some spectral
    reflectance data do exist for these objects.
 
    Nine asteroids in the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey paper (Zellner et
    al. 1985 [ZELLNERETAL1985]) had not yet been numbered at the time of
    publication, but they are all numbered now and are identified by their
    number in this data set.  They are cross- referenced by their
    publication designation here:
 
      1979 VA      (4015) Wilson-Harrington
      1980 WF      (4688)
      1981 LA      (3169) Ostro
      1981 QA      (3102) Krok
      1981 QF2     (3123) Dunham
      1981 VB      (3124) Kansas
      1982 DV      (3288) Seleucus
      1982 RA      (3199) Nefertiti
      1982 XB      (3757)
 
 
  Modification History
  ====================
    The asteroid taxonomy data set was first reviewed and ingested in
    1993, and is now updated to include the neural net taxonomy of Howell
    et al. (1994) [HOWELLETAL1994].
 
    The current version of the data set (version 2) was reviewed in March
    1997, but the liens were not corrected in time for the data set to be
    included in the 1997 delivery.  It is being included in the 1998
    delivery of data sets, although it was reviewed in 1997.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    The data table includes taxonomic classifications and the parameters
    used to derived that classification in each of the Tholen, Barucci,
    Tedesco and Howell systems.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set underwent external peer review on March 24, 1997.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Four entries have a notation in the comment field.  The classification
    for (152) Atala in the original reference is based on data that have
    been found to be inconsistent with other observations.  The current
    belief is that this object may have been misidentified during the
    course of the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey, therefore the Tholen
    classification has been change to &apos;I&apos; to reflect inconsistent data;
    the Howell et al. (1994) [HOWELLETAL1994] classification reflects the
    inconsistency.
 
    The classifications for (2151) Hadwiger and (2422) Perovskaya are
    based on UBV colors published by Bowell et al. (1979)
    [BOWELLETAL1979], where they are identified as 1975 EA and 1975 GB,
    respectively.  These designations are not the principal provisional
    designations (which are actually 1977 VX and 1968 HK1, respectively),
    therefore the proper identity of these objects in the original Bowell
    et al. table will not be obvious unless a listing of asteroid
    identifications is consulted.
 
    The classification for 1975 RC is also based on UBV colors published
    by Bowell et al. (1979) [BOWELLETAL1979], where it is identified as
    1975 U2, which is not a proper provisional designation.  Efforts to
    determine the correct identity of this object revealed that 1975 U2
    appears to be a designation assigned by C.-I. Lagerkvist for his own
    personal use (prior to his learning of the formal provisional
    designation), but it was apparently also communicated to E. F.
    Tedesco, the observer of the colors.  There was sufficient confusion
    generated by the investigation, however, that potential users of this
    classification should be warned that the identification of 1975 U2 as
    1975 RC may be incorrect.
