    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Cassini Radio Science Titan Bistatic experiment (TBIS3)
      Raw Data Archive is a time-ordered collection of radio science raw
      data acquired on October 23 and 24, 2014, during the Cassini
      the Cassini Extended Extended Mission.
 
      The DATA_SET_ID &apos;CO-SSA-RSS-1-TBIS3-V1.0&apos; includes the following
      components:
          Instrument host (i.e., &apos;CO&apos; for CASSINI ORBITER)
          Target (i.e., &apos;SSA&apos; for Saturn Satellite)
          Instrument (i.e., &apos;RSS&apos; for Radio Science Subsystem)
          Data processing level number (i.e., &apos;1&apos;)
          Description (i.e., &apos;TBIS3&apos;)
          Version number (i.e., &apos;V1.0&apos;)
 
      Two types of measurements were obtained; these are known
      as closed-loop and open-loop recordings.  The closed-loop
      system uses a phase-lock loop in the receiver to track the
      downlink signal, reporting both amplitude and frequency 10
      times per second.  In the open-loop system, the signal is
      simply converted to a baseband frequency range; the entire
      passband is sampled and recorded at 16000 samples per second.
 
      The data set includes three primary data types.  Tracking and
      Navigation Service Data Files (TNFs) are the most primitive (and
      most voluminous) product of the closed-loop system. Orbit Data Files
      (ODFs) are compressed versions of TNFs, specifically targeted to
      spacecraft navigators and scientists interested in gravity fields.
      Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are the primary data type from
      the open-loop system.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The TNF is the primary output from the Cassini closed-loop system.
      Each TNF in the data set is accompanied by a PDS label which
      defines both the content and the format of the file.
      TNF data fields include:
           High- or low-rate Doppler
           Range
           Uplink frequencies (ramps)
           Differential Range vs Integrated Doppler (DRVID)
           Allan deviation
           Smoothed noise
      Other information in TNF data records includes sample date and
      time; spacecraft ID; ground station and its configuration;
      status flags and values reported by various ground systems;
      calibration values, noise estimates, and tolerances (station
      delay, transmitter power, etc.); and signal strength.
 
      The ODF is a product of the closed-loop system;it contains the most
      important information (range, Doppler and frequency ramps) needed by
      spacecraft navigators, and investigators interested in determining
      gravitational fields.  Each ODF is accompanied by a full PDS label
      which describes both the content and format of the associated file.
      ODF data fields include:
           One-way Doppler (Hertz)
           Two-way Doppler (Hertz)
           Three-way Doppler (Hertz)
           SRA planetary operational discrete spectrum range (range
                units)
 
      The Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are the primary output
      from the Cassini open-loop system and they contain 16-bit samples
      of receiver output. Each RSR file is accompanied by a full PDS label
      which describes both the content and format of the file at the
      bit level.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The closed-loop Tracking and Navigation Service Files (TNFs)
      and the  Orbit Data Files (ODFs) for the Cassini TBIS3 are
      constructed so that each file contains the data for each day.
 
      ODFs are constructed by the RMDCT; they are constructed so that
      each file contains the data for each day.
 
      The open-loop Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are screened for
      gaps.  No gaps were found in the RSR files for TBIS3.
 
 
    Primary Data
    ============
      The primary data are stored on DVD volumes in subdirectories TNF,
      ODF, and RSR in per-day directories TIGR5_ddd (where ddd specifies
      the day of year based on the start time of the data). Users should
      refer to the INDEX/CUMINDEX.TAB listing to locate primary data files.
 
      TNFs are stored in the TNF directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.TNF,
      where &apos;sss&apos; is the sequence/orbit id (e.g., S23), &apos;tt&apos; is the
      target id (e.g., SR),&apos;aa&apos; is the activity/experiment id (e.g., OC),
      &apos;yyyy_ddd_hhmm&apos; is the date and time for the start of included data
      (e.g., 2006_258_1901), &apos;xuu&apos; is the transmitter band and uplink
      station (e.g., X55), &apos;w&apos; is the ground mode or &apos;way&apos; (e.g., M
      for multiple ground modes) and Vn is the file version number
      (e.g., V1).
      The PDS label has file name sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.LBL.
      For this archive, the typical TNF contains about 330 Mbytes.
 
 
            ODFs are stored in the ODF directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.ODF.
      The PDS label has file name sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.LBL.
      For this archive, the typical ODF contains about 22 Mbytes.
 
      RSR files are stored in the RSR directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyyddd_hhmmxuudrrPD.rcs,
      where &apos;sss&apos; is the sequence, (e.g., S23), &apos;tt&apos; is the target,
      (e.g., RS), &apos;aa&apos; is the activity, (e.g., OE), &apos;yyyy&apos; is the
      year, (e.g., 2006), &apos;hhmm&apos; is the start time, (e.g., 1955),
      &apos;xuu&apos; is the uplink band and uplinking station, (e.g., X14 or
      NNN for no uplink),
      &apos;drr&apos; is the downlink band and receiving station, (e.g., K25),
      P is the polarization, (e.g., R for right circular polarization),
      and &apos;rcs&apos; is the RSR, channel and subchannel that were used to
      collect the data (e.g., 1A1). The PDS label has file name
      sssttaayyyyddd_hhmmxuudrrPD.LBL. The typical RSR contains
      about 900 Mbytes.
 
 
    Secondary Data
    ==============
      Secondary data are needed for proper analysis and interpretation
      of the radio data (file type, RSR). Secondary data
      that cover a time span of 24 hours or less are stored in
      subdirectories of TBIS3_ddd (i.e., 158, PD1, PD2 and TLM).
      Secondary data that cover a time span greater than 24 hours are
      provided in subdirectories CKF, EOP, ION, SPK and TRO in the
      TBIS3_ANCILLARY directory. Users should refer to the
      INDEX/CUMINDEX.TAB listing to locate secondary data files.

    Files in the CALIB Directory
    =============================
       The CALIB directory contains a Leapsecond kernel file, a Spacecraft
       Clock Conversion file, a USO Characterization Report and a
       Boresight Calibration Report. All files in the CALIB directory are
       ASCII text files with variable length records delimited by
       ASCII carriage-return line-feed pairs. All file names in this
       directory contain the string &apos;yymmdd&apos;, where yy, mm, dd
       indicate the year, month and day of the file creation.
 
       Leapsecond kernel files are a record of leap seconds (past and
       predicted) that allow proper conversion between ephemeris time
       and UTC. File names are of the form:
 
                 LSK_yymmdd.TLS

       BORESIGHT_yymmdd.TXT
 
       USO_yymmdd.TXT
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      SPK files are produced in the J2000 inertial
      reference frame. Other data types are not dependent on any
      definition of a coordinate system.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing data such as
      these has been developed at JPL and elsewhere. Because such
      software must usually operate at the bit-level and is written
      for a narrow range of platforms, it is unsuitable for
      general distribution. As such, no software is included with
      this archival data set.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The archival data set is written on DVD-R media. The DVD-R volumes
      conform to the &apos;UDF_ISO-9660_BRIDGE&apos; structure as required by PDS.
        </data_set_desc>
        <confidence_level_note>
 
    Overview
    ========
      In general, this is a good data set.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the Cassini Radio Science
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
     The data are contained in 12 volumes (DVDs) - CORS_0513
     through CORS_0524 - and they cover the Radio Science  Titan
     Bistatic experiment, which was done on October 23 and 24, 2014.
     There are no known problems with this data set.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      The limitations in this data set follow from the quality of
      the execution, which is described above under Data Coverage
      and Quality.
