      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This dataset presents a collection of 2334 published and 319
      unpublished results in cometary polarimetry. The database
      contains 2653 measurements of linear and circular polarization for
      65 comets since 1940. The narrow-band and broad-band measurements
      within the spectral region 0.3-3.5 micron are presented. The ranges
      of phase angles, helio- and geocentric distances of comets are
      0.4-122 deg, 0.6-4.8 AU and 0.03-4.9 AU, respectively. We have
      compiled 64 references to the published papers and some unpublished
      sources. The data are presented in a tabular format (ASCII code).
      The database can be used as the observational basis for detailed
      theoretical modeling, interpretation of the phase-angle and spectral
      dependence of polarization, classification of comets, and for
      selecting future space-mission targets.
 
      The Database of Comet Polarimetry (DBCP.TAB) was initiated in 2005
      with a goal to collect an cataloque of all available data for the
      linear and circular polarization of comets.
 
      A total of 65 comets are includung in this version of the DBCP.
      The data obtained during the years 1940 - 2005 were collected
      from the different published sources and partially unpublished
      observations of authors this database. Observations were carried
      out using various telescopes and various polarimetric equipment
      including photographic, photoelectric and imaging techniques.
 
      DBCP is a current agglomeration cataloque and new data will be
      added to it periodically.
 
      Parameters
      ==========
      The primary data included in each record includes polarization
      parameters and filter descriptions.  N. Kisilev provided the
      following explanation of the polarization parameters recorded
      in the data file:
 
        Generally polarization can be described by means of the Stokes
        parameters I, Q, U and V. The link between the Stokes parameters
        and the geometry of a polarization ellipse is given by:
 
          I = a**2
          Q = a**2 cos 2beta cos 2theta
          U = a**2 cos 2beta sin 2theta
          V = a**2 sin 2beta
 
        where
          a         represents the ellipse size
          tan beta  is the ratio of the minor to major axes
                    (beta = 0 for linear and pi/2 for circular
                     polarization)
          theta     is the orientation of the ellipse
 
        In most cases observers measured four intensities J at polarizer
        angles 0, 45, 90 and 135 degree in a given reference system.
        Then for light with an arbitrary linear polarization the Stokes
        parameters are:
 
              I = J(0)+J(90)   = J(45)+J(135)
              Q = J(0)-J(90)   = Ip cos2theta
              U = J(45)-J(135) = Ip sin2theta
              P = 100sqrt(Q**2+U**2)/I   [percent of linear polarization]
          theta = 1/2arctg(U/Q)          [position angle of plane of
                                          polarization]
 
        The most commonly used related parameter is theta(r), referring
        to the scattering plane
 
          theta(r) = theta-(Sca+/-90)
 
        where Sca is the position angle of the scattering plane and the
        sign in the parentheses is chosen to guarantee 0&lt;Sca+/-90&lt;180
        (Chernova et al. 1993, Icarus 103, 144-158). Consequently,
        theta(r) is the deviation of the plane of polarization from the
        direction perpendicular to the plane of scattering. By convention,
        linear polarization is positive if -45&lt;theta(r)&lt;45 and it is
        negative if 135&gt;theta(r)&gt;45. Thus, sign of the polarization quoted
        in the data table is determined by value of theta(r) that is given
        in the same record.
 
        More commonly, the negative percent of polarization for the whole
        coma of comets is larger than -5% and occurs at phase angles less
        than approximately 22 degrees. An exception to the rule is comet
        C/Ikeya-Seki (1965 S1), for which the percent of polarization in
        the tail was about -40% at phase angle 44 degrees.
 
      Processing
      ==========
      The details of the data processing are reported in the individual
      papers (file references.tab).  Users should note that the only the
      original papers provide any information about polarization bias
      correction.

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      The dataset contains the errors for linear polarization, the angle of
      the polarization plane, and circular polarization indicated in the
      corresponding columns of the main table.
 
      Users must consult the original papers for polarization bias
      correction.
