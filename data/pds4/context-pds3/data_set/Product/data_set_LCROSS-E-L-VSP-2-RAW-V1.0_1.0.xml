    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    This data set contains raw spectra from the LCROSS
    Visible Spectrometer (VSP).  This instrument&apos;s boresight
    was parallel to the payload reference boresight (Near
    Infrared Spectrometer #1).  After the centaur impact,
    the spacecraft kept the impact site within the field of
    view of this instrument until shortly before its own
    impact.
 
    Each file in this dataset contains a 1024 pixel spectra
    plus 20 reference pixels in an ascii, single-column,
    tabular format.  Integration time varied and is noted in
    the labels.  The spectrometer&apos;s field of view was
    circular and 1 degree in diameter.
 
    The spectra in this dataset have targets named Moon,
    Earth and Calibration (i.e., not targeted).
 
    The time each spectra was captured is encoded in the
    spectra&apos;s filename like this:
 
      LCROSS_VSP_RAW_&lt;timestamp&gt;.IMG
 
    where &lt;timestamp&gt; = YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm
      and YYYY = the four digit year;
          MM = the two digit month,
          DD = the two digit day, and so on
          through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
 
    The detached label for each spectra has the same
    filename as the spectra but with the &apos;LBL&apos; extension.
 
    This dataset encompasses all raw spectra collected by
    the VSP during the mission.  Note that the archive&apos;s
    DATA directory is partitioned initially by payload data
    collection period.  The data collection period called
    20091009113022_IMPACT contains the data from one minute
    prior to the Centaur impact through the end of the
    mission.  Other data collection periods periods contain
    data from various calibration targets.
 
    Related Data Sets
    =================
 
    The VSP_CAL dataset contains the calibrated versions of
    the spectra in this dataset.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
       Science
       -------
 
       Integration time varies between spectra and is noted
       in milliseconds by the EXPOSURE_DURATION attribute in
       the label files.
 
       Housekeeping
       ------------
 
       Instrument temperature at the data collection time is
       reported in the label file under:
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE and
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE_COUNT in degrees Centigrade
       and raw counts, respectively.  This is a single
       telemetry point most representative of the instrument
       chassis temperature.
 
       The thermoelectric cooler control setpoint and
       best-estimate detector temperature temperature are
       noted in degrees centigrade in the
       LCROSS:TEC_SETPOINT and LCROSS:TEC_TEMPERATURE
       attributes, respectively.
 
       The VSP implemented a &apos;bracket&apos; exposure mode
       intended to vary the integration time to compensate
       for uncertainty about the expected scene.  In this
       mode, the spectrometer captured three spectra in
       quick succession with short, medium and long
       integration times.  Other than integration time, no
       other aspect of data collection was changed.  This
       aspect of VSP data collection is visible in the
       LCROSS:VSP_BRACKET_NUMBER and LCROSS:PACKET_TIMESTAMP
       attributes, which allow PDS-formatted spectra to be
       tracked back to the slot in the telemetry packet they
       were created from.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
    Each visible and ultraviolet light spectra was digitally
    transmitted from the spectrometer to the spacecraft with
    error detection, inserted into a packet uncompressed and
    downlinked in telemetry.  On the ground, the spectra
    were extracted from telemetry and converted to CSV
    format.  The LCROSS Make Archive program read these
    files and wrote them as PDS-formatted (.TAB) and label
    (.LBL) files.
 
    Data
    ====
 
    The files in this dataset are PDS-formatted, ascii,
    single-column tables with detached label files.
 
    Each table contains one 1024 pixel spectra in its first
    1024 rows, followed by 20 reference pixels.  File rows
    [1031,1032] inclusive may be used as dark pixels.  They
    are at the long wavelength end of the spectrometer.
    Rile rows [1036,1038] inclusive may also be used as dark
    pixels, and they are at the short wavelength end.  All
    other, non-spectral rows are unused.  These indices
    label the first row of the file as row #1.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    TBD
 
    Software
    ========
 
    The GSEOS Version used to generate these spectra is GSEOS
    5.2.407 (Feb 25, 2008), Python 2.2.3 (#37, Nov 28, 2003,
    04:20:20), Project Version 6.1.064.
 
    The LCROSS.py Python script used with GSEOS is Version
    Jun 11, 2008.
 
    The LCROSS Report Generator used on GSEOS created
    CCSDS.dat files is version 114.
 
    The version of Satellite Toolkit used to prepare geometric
    information for the labels is 8.1.3.
 
    The LCROSS Make Archive program used to assemble the
    PDS-formatted submission is dated 03/14/2010.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    The confidence level is unspecified.
 
    Review
    ======
 
    This LCROSS data set was reviewed internally by the
    LCROSS science team before delivery to PDS.  This data
    set has passed a PDS peer review.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    This data path from spectrometer to PDS involved no
    lossy compression and was fully error corrected.  No VSP
    packets were lost in downlink.
 
    During the preimpact and impact data collection periods,
    the VSP was miscommanded due to delays associated with
    an overloaded science computer (DHU).  This resulted in
    some spectra with integration times different from those
    intended.  Also, in the case of 10 out of 1873 spectra,
    the reported integration times were incorrect, and these
    times have been corrected.  After correction, the
    integration times in the label files reflect what
    actually occurred.
 
    Some VSP spectra were saturated.  These are flagged in
    the label files by the LCROSS:SATURATION_FLAG attribute.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
 
    Noted under data coverage and quality.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
 
    No data compression was used in the datapath from the
    detector to the formatted files ready for submission to
    the PDS.
