    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This volume contains portions of the CRISM Experiment Data Record
      (EDR) Archive, a collection of image cubes from the Compact
      Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars on the Mars
      Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.  Images are stored with PDS
      labels, but are otherwise unprocessed and uncalibrated.
 
      This volume also contains ancillary data files and browse images
      in PNG format, HTML documents that support a web browser interface
      to the volume, an index file (&apos;imgindx.tab&apos;) that tabulates the
      contents of the volume, and documentation files.
 
      For more information on the contents and organization of the
      volume set refer to the aareadme.txt file located in the root
      directory of the data volumes.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
      CRISM observing scenarios are constructed using a set of key
      variables (&apos;configurations&apos;) which include the following: (All
      are selectable separately for the VNIR and IR detectors).
 
      Image source: Image data may be generated using digitized output
      from the detector, or using one of up to seven test patterns.
 
      Row selection:  All detector rows having useful signal can be
      saved, or alternatively an arbitrary, commandable subset of rows
      can be saved. The number of rows with useful signal is 545, 107
      in the VNIR and 438 in the IR. The nominal number of rows for
      multispectral mode was 73, 18 in the VNIR and 55 in the IR prior
      to 10 Dec 2006. On that date an extra channel was added to the
      VNIR for a total of 19. For each detector, there are four
      options of channel selection to choose from rapidly by command:
      hyperspectral (545 total channels), multispectral (73 total
      channels prior to 10 Dec 2006, 74 total channels on and after 10
      Dec 2006), and two sets of expanded multispectral (84 and 92
      channels prior to 10 Dec 2006, 85 and 93 channels on and after
      10 Dec 2006). An analogy is a car radio preset button. New
      options are set by uploading a data structure to the DPU. Data
      with any wavelength selection may have a corresponding TRDR, but
      the wavelength selection affects the wavelength continuity and
      dimensionality of a TRDR.
 
      Pixel binning: Pixels can be saved unbinned or binned 2x, 5x, or
      10x in the spatial direction. No pixel binning in the spectral
      direction is supported.
 
      Compression: All CRISM data are read off the detector in 14-bit
      format and are compressed real-time in hardware. Compression
      options, in succession, are: (1) Subtraction of an offset, on a
      line by line basis.  Offsets are set by uploading a data
      structure to the DPU. (2) Multiplication by a gain, on a line by
      line basis, with the output in 12-bit format.  Gains are set by
      uploading a data structure to the DPU.  (Raw 12-bit data are
      stored onground in data products as 16-bit numbers.) (3)
      Optionally, conversion from 12 to 8 bits using one of eight
      look-up tables (LUTs) specified on a line by line basis.  These
      choices are set by uploading a data structure to the DPU.  (4)
      Optionally, lossless Fast + differential pulse-code modulation
      (DPCM) compression.
 
      Pointing:  CRISM has two basic gimbal pointing configurations and
      two basic superimposed scan patterns.  Pointing can be (1) fixed
      (nadir-pointed in the primary science orbit) or (2) dynamic,
      tracking a target point on the surface of Mars and taking out
      ground track motion.  Two types of superimposed scans are
      supported: (1) a short, 4-second duration fixed-rate (&apos;EPF-type&apos;)
      scan which superimposes a constant angular velocity scan on either
      of the basic pointing profiles, or (2) a long, minutes-duration
      fixed-rate (&apos;target swath-type&apos;) scan.
 
      Frame rate: Frame rates of 1, 3.75, 5, 15, and 30 Hz are
      supported. The 1 Hz frame rate is used for hyperspectral
      measurements of the onboard integrating sphere, because the long
      exposures possible at 1 Hz are needed for appreciable SNR at the
      shortest wavelengths. 3.75 Hz is used for hyperspectral
      measurements of Mars; this is the highest frame rate at which the
      DPU electronics support onboard compression options over the range
      of wavelengths imaged onto the detectors with useful SNR.  15 and
      30 Hz frame rates are used for nadir-pointed multispectral
      measurements that return only selected wavelengths. The 5 Hz frame
      rate is not planned for use in flight, because at that rate the
      electronics do no support compression of a hyperspectral
      wavelength selection, and it would produce excessive along-track
      smear in a nadir-pointed observation.
 
      Integration time:  Integration times are in increments of 1/480th
      of the inverse of the frame rate. At 1 Hz, for example, available
      integration times are 1/480th sec, 2/480th sec...480/480th , and
      at 15 Hz, 1/7200th sec, 2/7200th sec...480/7200th sec.
 
      Calibration lamps: 4095 levels are commandable in each of two
      lamps at each focal plane, and in two lamps in the integrating
      sphere. All lamps can be commanded open-loop, meaning that current
      is commanded directly.  For the integrating sphere only, closed
      loop control is available at 4095 settings. For closed loop
      control, the setting refers to output from a photodiode viewing
      the interior of the integrating sphere; current is adjusted
      dynamically to attain the commanded photodiode output. Note: lamps
      reach maximum current at open- or closed-loop settings &lt;4095.
 
      Shutter position:  Open, closed, or viewing the integrating
      sphere. The shutter is actually commandable directly to position 0
      through 32.  In software, open=3, sphere=17, closed=32. NOTE:
      during integration and testing, it was discovered that at
      positions &lt;3 the hinge end of the shutter is directly illuminated
      and creates scattered light. Position 3 does not cause this
      effect, but the other end of the shutter slightly vignettes
      incoming light.
 
      Pointing:  CRISM has two basic gimbal pointing configurations and
      two basic superimposed scan patterns.  Pointing can be (1) fixed
      (nadir-pointed in the primary science orbit) or (2) dynamic,
      tracking a target point on the surface of Mars and taking out
      ground track motion.  Two types of superimposed scans are
      supported: (1) a short, 4-second duration fixed-rate (&apos;EPF-type&apos;)
      scan which superimposes a constant angular velocity scan on either
      of the basic pointing profiles, or (2) a long, minutes-duration
      fixed-rate (&apos;target swath-type&apos;) scan. Pointing configuration
      affects the contents but not the dimensionality of an EDR.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The CRISM data stream downlinked by the spacecraft unpacks into a
      succession of compressed image frames with binary headers
      containing housekeeping. In each image, one direction is spatial
      and one is spectral.  There is one image for the VNIR focal plane
      and one image for the IR focal plane. The image from each focal
      plane has a header with 220 housekeeping items that contain full
      status of the instrument hardware, including data configuration,
      lamp and shutter status, gimbal position, a time stamp, and the
      target ID and macro within which the frame of data was taken.
      These parameters are stored as part of an Experiment Data Record
      (EDR), which consists of raw data.
 
      The data in one EDR represent a series of image frames
      acquired with a consistent instrument configuration (shutter
      position, frame rate, pixel binning, compression, exposure time,
      on/off status and setting of different lamps). Each frame has
      dimensions of detector columns (spatial samples) and detector
      rows (wavelengths, or bands). The multiple image frames are
      concatenated, and are formatted into a single multiple-band
      image (suffix *.IMG) in one file, plus a detached list file in
      which each record has housekeeping information specific to one
      frame of the multiple-band image (suffix *.TAB).
 
      The text file is based on the 220 housekeeping items. Five
      of theitems are composite in that each byte encodes
      particular information on gimbal status or control. These separate
      items are not broken out, except for the gimbal status at the
      beginning, middle, and end of each exposure, from which gimbal
      position is broken out (3 additional items).  The housekeeping is
      pre-pended with 10 additional frame-specific items useful in data
      validation, processing, and sorting, for a total of 233 items per
      frame.  Further information can be found in the data product SIS
      in the DOCUMENT directory.
 
      The multiple-band image has dimensions of
      sample, line, and wavelength. The size of the multiple-band image
      varies according to the observation mode but is deterministic
      given the macro ID. A typical multiple-band image might have XX
      pixels in the sample (cross-track) dimension, YY pixels in the
      line (along-track) dimension, and ZZ pixels in the wavelength
      dimension, where:
 
      XX (samples) = 640/binning, where 640 is the number of columns
      read off the detector, and binning is 1, 2, 5, or 10;
 
      YY (lines) = the number of image frames with a consistent
      instrument configuration; and
 
      ZZ (bands) = the number of detector rows (wavelengths) whose
      read-out values are retained by the instrument.
 
 
    Data
    ====
 
      There is only one data type associated with this volume, the raw
      uncalibrated DNs.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      There are various types of ancillary data provided with this
      dataset:
 
      1. SPICE kernels, used to interpret observational geometry, are
      available in the GEOMETRY directory.   See GEOMINFO.TXT for more
      details.
 
      2. The EXTRAS directory contains materials that may be helpful but
      are beyond the scope of the required elements of the archive.
      This includes a time ordered history of observations and the
      characteristics of the sites observed, as well as the
      configuration-managed history of the hardware and software state
      of the CRISM instrument.  See EXTRINFO.TXT for more details.
 
      3. The BROWSE directory contains browse images in PNG format, and
      HTML documents that support a web browser interface to the volume.
      See BROWINFO.TXT for more details.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      The cartographic coordinate system used for the CRISM data
      products conforms to the IAU planetocentric system with East
      longitudes being positive. The IAU2000 reference system for Mars
      cartographic coordinates and rotational elements was used for
      computing latitude and longitude coordinates.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      The CRISM archive will be made available online via Web and FTP
      servers.  This will be the primary means of distribution.
      Therefore the archive will be organized as a set of virtual
 
      volumes, with each data set stored online as a single volume. As
      new data products are released they will be added to the volume&apos;s
      data directory, and the volume&apos;s index table will be updated
      accordingly. The size of the volume will not be limited by the
      capacity of the physical media on which it is stored; hence the
      term virtual volume.  When it is necessary to transfer all or part
      of a data set to other media such as DVD for distribution or for
      offline storage, the virtual volume&apos;s contents will be written to
      the other media according to PDS policy, possibly dividing the
      contents among several physical volumes.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This is a TBD data set.  Known problems are TBD.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set will be examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The
      peer review will be conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      For each observation, every EDR is compared against frame-by-frame
      predictions of commanded instrument state. The results of the
      comparison are written as a data validation report that
      accompanies the EDRs for that observation.
 
      In the case of a hardware or configuration discrepancy (shutter
      position, lamp status or level, pixel binning, frame rate, channel
      selection, power status of detectors), processing of the image
      data to RDR level does not occur in order to avoid introducing
      invalid results. Missing frames or portions of frames are replaced
      with a value of 65535 (this cannot be a valid data value) and only
      that portion of the EDR is not further processed.
 
      If an expected calibration data set (background, focal plane lamp,
      or sphere) is not successfully acquired and downloaded, the next
      closest in time calibration can be used. In this case there is a
      discrepancy between the predicted EDR processing table and the
      actual one, and this is recorded in the data quality index upon
      processing of the scene EDR to the TRDR level.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
