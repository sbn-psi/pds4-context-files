 Data Set Overview and Parameters
 ================================
 
The XRS Level 2 data products in this archive include daily
time series of spectra collected by the instrument along with
selected spacecraft engineering and instrument configuration and
orbital ephemerides. Supporting documentation includes as to the
specifics of how these data were generated.  A supporting BROWSE
facility was included to facilitate high level overview of
asteroid and solar flourescence activity, which is in the form of
time and resolution correlated histographic images of flourescence
detection by the asteroid and solar pointing detectors.  Asteroid
surface coverage is included in the form of an image with six
orthogonal views of the asteroid of counts collected by the
asteroid pointing unfiltered detector.  The daily images are
integrated through an XRS browser facility XGRSBROWSE.HTML included
BROWSE Directory.
 
The XRS Level-3 data products in this archive include the most optimal
XRS sampling of flourescence of the asteroid surface during selected
solar flares.  These data include specific time series of spectra
collected by the instrument along with selected spacecraft
engineering and instrument configuration and orbital ephemerides.
This portion of the data set is identical to the Level-2 format
specific to the time of each flare.  A second partition of the
data set is a derived product in which a composite set of data is
generated by summing spectra to increase signal to noise during the
flare.  Selected ephemerides and engineering parameters are averaged
for the composite set of information.
 
  Processing
  ==========
 
The Level 2and 3 data products comprise the time series of the XRS
instrument&apos;s science data in physical units. At each integration
time the instrument Data Processing Unit (DPU) samples instrument
spectra accumulated during the integration period as well as
instrument and engineering configuration information.  Ground
processing activities at the University of Arizona produce Derived
Engineering and Spatial Ephemerides information.  The Level-2/3 data
are then combined into integral products within a relational
database and exported as an integral Level-2 product. Each XRS record
is comprised of the following logical data units:
 
 Spectra:                  4, (256 Channel) Spectra (UNF, MG, AL, SOL)
                               UNF = Unfiltered:  Asteroid Pointing
                               MG  = Magnesium:   Asteroid Pointing
                               AL  = Aluminum:    Asteroid Pointing
                               SOL = Solar:       Sun Pointing
 Instrument HouseKeeping:  Instrument Rates and activity
 Engineering Housekeeping: Engineering Configurations (volts, etc.)
 Derived Engineering:      Ground derived data products
 Spatial                   Orbital Ephemerides
 
   Data and Ancillary Files
   ========================
 
Files for Level-2 are organized into a series of time subdirectories
below the top-level directory. For level 3 the subdirectories are orgainzed
according to the initial onset of a solar event time period.
 
 
   Coordinate System
   =================
   All products were derived in the Asteroid Body Fixed Coordinate
   System
 
   Software
   ========
   These products were derived from a specialized ground
   processing system developed at the University of Arizona
   Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.  All derived products are
   described in the DOCUMENT Section of this volume:
 
   Requirement Specifications For Level-2 Parameters Required
   Stored or Derived by The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
   (NEAR) X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) Ground System
 
   Media

    Overview
    ========
      Data in this archive have been reduced as part of mission data
      analysis activities of the NEAR XGRS  Science Team.  Data of
      questionable validity have been omitted from the solutions.
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the NEAR XGRS
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      It was one of several data sets included in a comprehensive
      review by the PDS Small Bodies Node in August 2001, prior to
      PDS acceptance and ingestion.
 
 
    =========================
      The data included in this archive were collected during the
      NEAR orbital phase from 2000-02-14 to 2001-02-12.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
    None
