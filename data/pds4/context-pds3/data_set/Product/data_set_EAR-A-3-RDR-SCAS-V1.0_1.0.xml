            The Seven-color Asteroid Survey (SCAS) was conducted at the IRTF
            on Mauna Kea, Hawaii from 1992 to 1994. It consists of photometry
            in seven filters from 0.9 to 2.3 microns, lettered A through G in
            order of increasing wavelength. The bandpasses were specifically
            designed to capture the essential mineralogic information present
            in infrared asteroid spectra. The filter bandpasses were chosen
            to avoid the atmospheric water features at 1.4 and 1.9 microns.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
  The Seven-color Asteroid Survey (SCAS) was conducted at the IRTF on
  Mauna Kea, Hawaii from 1992 to 1994.  It consists of photometry in
  seven filters from 0.9 to 2.3 microns, lettered A through G in
  order of increasing wavelength.  The bandpasses were specifically
  designed to capture the essential mineralogic information present
  in infrared asteroid spectra.  The filter bandpasses were chosen to
  avoid the atmospheric water features at 1.4 and 1.9 microns.
 
  126 asteroids are included in this data set.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
  The reflectances have been normalized to band A, at 0.913 microns,
  and are thus referred to as B/A, C/A, D/A, E/A, F/A, and G/A.  The
  band difference B-D (actually the difference in the normalized
  values) is also tabulated as an indicator of band depth/continuum
  slope.  Also included are the RMS errors associated with each
  value.
 
  The B-D band difference is a strong indicator of the main source of
  variation in the SCAS data set.  In Clark, et al. (1995)
  [CLARKETAL1995] it is shown that B-D can be used to distinguish
  between typical S-class asteroid spectra and typical K-class
  spectra.  B-D essentially measures the depth of the 1-micron
  absorption feature, in which band B is located, as compared to the
  continuum just outside the 1-micron feature, where band D is
  located.
