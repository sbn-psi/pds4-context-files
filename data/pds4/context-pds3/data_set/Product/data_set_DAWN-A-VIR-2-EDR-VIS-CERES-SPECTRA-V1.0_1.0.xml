  Processing
  ==========
    The data in this data set are raw, CODMAC Level 2 data. As such, no
    processes have been applied to the data other than decompression and
    reformatting as cubes.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The data are in PDS format. A detailed description of the data format
    is given in the VIR SIS document located in the DOCUMENT directory of
    this data set.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    No ancillary data included in this data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
      The geometry items SC_SUN_POSITION_VECTOR,
      SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR and SC_TARGET_VELOCITY_VECTOR
      provided in the label of the data product are relative to the
      Earth Mean Equator frame of J2000.
 
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE are
      given in the PLANETOCENTRIC coordinate system. These parameters
      are corrected for planetary and stellar aberrations.
      Distances are given in km, angles in degrees.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Data confidence is nominal, meaning that all data have been
    validated by the VIR team and found as expected. Any exceptions
    are noted by the DATA_QUALITY field in the label files.
 
    Following the loss of the 2nd reaction wheel during Vesta departure,
    Dawn had to rely on the RCS thrusters, rather than reaction wheels,
    to maintain pointing. While the Dawn system does not employ true
    dead-banding, the net result of the thruster firings is to introduce
    pointing offsets of up to +/- 0.64 degrees in +X and +Y, and rates of
    up to 0.01 degrees/second (or ~ 0.7 VIR pixels/second). The
    combination of long VIR integration times with large pointing and
    pointing rate errors complicates interpreting the data acquired as
    normal spectral cubes. When Dawn is near to Ceres, the timing of
    the thruster firings is moderately predicable with the most common
    attitude near one of the deadband limits. When Dawn is far from its
    selected target the thruster firing is more random and the impact of
    not being pointed at Ceres nadir is amplified. This is especially
    apparent in the VIR cubes since each frame of the cube effectively
    has its own pointing. During Approach and RC3, Ceres is highly
    distored in the raw data cubes and care must taken to properly
    correct the geometry when calibrating and interpretting these data.
 
  Review
  ======
    These are the same data files that were utilized by the Dawn Science
    Team. Any errors or deficiencies reported by the Science Team were
    corrected by the VIR team. Note, however, that the geometry information
    provided in the PDS labels was updated to reflect the IAU coordinate
    system updated to Dawn derived pole right ascension and declination
    values. A full PDS peer review was conducted of all products in this
    data set.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    Data coverage is good unless otherwise noted by the DATA_QUALITY
    keyword.
 
    Dropouts that may be observed in some images are due to instrument
    saturation. The spectral range in which these dropouts occur varies
    depending upon exposure duration, target topography, and incidence
    angle.
 
    The spacecraft safed as it entered the RC3 mission phase. As a result,
    the cubes in the first rotation of the RC3 Equatorial Limb 001 (South)
    high phase observations were lost.
 
    The VIR instrument reset in Survey cycles 4 and 8 before any science
    data were discharged to spacecraft memory so these data were completely
    lost. Prior to and during the first few orbits of the Survey mission
    phase, the VIR cryocooler began showing signs of aging. As a result,
    Survey cycles 5 and 7 were acquired in VIS-only mode with the cryocooler
    turned off to preserve it for use during the HAMO mission phase.
 
    During the HAMO mission phase, the cryocooler set point was raised from
    75 deg Kelvin to 80 deg Kelvin to reduce the strain on the cooler. There
    is a slight decrease in the signal to noise ratio as a result of running
    the cooler at a warmer temperature. Cycles 3 and 5 of HAMO were acquired
    in IR-only mode in order to increase the number of IR frames that could
    be acquired. Orbit 6 of HAMO cycle 1 was also an IR-only orbit. After
    HAMO sequences were initially built and delivered to the Dawn project,
    the team decided to reduce the repetition time between frames in each
    cube. This reduced the size of the gaps between frames within cubes but
    increased the gaps between cubes.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    No limitations on these data
