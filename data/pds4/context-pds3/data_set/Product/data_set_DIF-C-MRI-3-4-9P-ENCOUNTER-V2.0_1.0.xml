  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional FITS images in this data set were
    generated by the Deep Impact calibration pipeline, maintained by the
    project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  For
    these data (version 2.0), geometric parameters were computed using
    the final kernels found in the PDS SPICE archive for Deep Impact.
 
    The pipeline performed the following reduction steps to produce the
    images in this data set:
 
      - Decompression of compressed images
      - Subtraction of a dark frame
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk
      - Application of a normalized flat field
      - Removal of CCD transfer smear
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration (&apos;RADREV&apos;)
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels for partially cleaned,
        radiometric calibration (&apos;RAD&apos;)
      - Conversion of cleaned radiance images (&apos;RAD&apos;) to I-over-F
        images (&apos;IF&apos;)
 
    The uncleaned radiance data, designated by the mnemonic &apos;RADREV&apos;,
    were provided in units of radiance as Watts/(meter**2 steradian
    micron).  These data were considered reversible because the
    calibration steps could be removed to get back to the original, raw
    data numbers.  Only the RADREV data were included in version 1.0 of
    this data set.
 
    The irreversibly cleaned radiance data, designated by the mnemonic
    &apos;RAD&apos;, were provided in units of radiance, Watts/(meter**2 steradian
    micron).  Cosmic rays were not removed because the existing
    calibration routine was not robust.
 
    Finally, each cleaned radiance (RAD) image was divided by the solar
    spectrum at the target body&apos;s distance from the sun then multiplied
    by pi to produce a unitless I/F (I-over-F) image.  These data were
    designated by the mnemonic &apos;IF&apos;.  Cosmic rays were not removed
    from these data.
 
    During the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension,
    to identify the following types of pixels:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information
      - Pixels considered bad as indicated by bad pixel maps (missing
        pixels were identified when the raw FITS files were created)
 
    The pipeline also created a FITS image extension for a signal-to-noise
    ratio map.  The calibration steps and files used to reduce each raw
    image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS
    data label for that image.  For a detailed discussion of the
    calibration pipeline and the resulting data, see the instrument
    calibration document by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006]
    included on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the image labels and FITS files is
      MVcccccccccc_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where cccccccccc is the
      spacecraft clock count at the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee
      is the exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels).  Up to 999
      individual images could be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      image number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER
      in the data labels.  For example, if two images were commanded for
      exposure ID 9009001, the two FITS files names would be
      MVcccccccccc_9009001_001_RR.FIT and MVcccccccccc_9009001_002_RR.FIT.
      Finally, rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (radiance units, reversible)
        R  for RAD data (radiance units, partially cleaned)
        I  for IF data (unitless I-over-F, partially cleaned)
 
 
    CCD Images
    ----------
      The two-dimensional, CCD images in this data set are in FITS format.
      The primary data array contains the image, followed by two image
      extensions that are pixel-by-pixel maps which provide additional
      information about the primary image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data label defines the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each image FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS label.  For
      more information about the FITS primary image and extensions, refer
      to the instrument calibration document included on the Deep Impact
      Documentation volume.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      A summary of the imaging modes is provided below.  All image modes
      are unbinned.  For a thorough description of the modes, please see
      the Deep Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005] included on the Deep Impact Documentation
      volume.

      Most image modes had a set of bias overclock rows and columns,
      located around the edges of the image array.  All overclock pixels
      were excluded from the calculation of the values for MINIMUM,
      MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.
 
 
    Filters
    -------
      A list of the characteristics of the MRI filters is provided
      below.  For more information about the filters, refer to the Deep
      Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005] and the instrument calibration document included
      on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.

    Compression
    -----------
      All data files in this data set were uncompressed.  If the
      associated raw data file was compressed on board the flyby
      spacecraft (and thus received on the ground and archived as
      compressed) then the calibration pipeline used one of four lossy
      lookup tables to decompress raw image.  For information about data
      compression, see the Deep Impact instruments document by Hampton,
      et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] or the instrument calibration
      paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006] included on the
      Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;As Seen By Observer&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the data labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = &apos;UP&apos;
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
      Using this convention for Tempel 1 approach images, ecliptic East is
      toward the top, ecliptic North is toward the right, and the Sun is
      down.  After impact, the Flyby spacecraft came out of shield mode
      and turned around to lookback at the comet.  For lookback images,
      ecliptic East is toward the top, ecliptic North is toward the left,
      and the Sun is down.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation of MRI flight images with those
      from ground-based calibrations as well as those from the High
      Resolution Instrument CCD (HRIV) and the Impactor Targeting Sensor
      CCD (ITS), see the quadrant nomenclature section of the &apos;Deep Impact
      Instrument Calibration&apos; document.
 
      It is important to note that, in published results about the
      encounter, the project elected to rotate MRI images such that
      ecliptic East is to the left, ecliptic North is up, and the Sun is
      to the right for approach images.  This is equivalent to rotating an
      image counter-clockwise by 90 degrees with respect to the convention
      provided above.  Published lookback images were rotated clockwise by
      90 degrees with with respect to the convention provided above such
      that ecliptic East to the right, ecliptic North up, and the Sun to
      the left.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Reduced RADREV and RAD data are in units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).  I/F data are unitless.
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      The TIME_FROM_IMPACT_VALUE keyword in the data labels was based
      on the best estimate of the time of impact based on the clock
      onboard the flyby spacecraft was UTC 05:44:34.265 on 4 Jul 2005.
      The analysis that lead to this estimate is discussed in the
      spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep Impact
      documentation volume.
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE in the data labels specified the
      the direction of ecliptic north as projected onto the image plane.
      It is measured from the &apos;upward&apos; direction, clockwise to the
      direction toward ecliptic north when the image is displayed as
      defined by the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION
      keywords.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the
      proper geometric information for the target of choice in many
      cases.  When these parameters could not be computed, the
      corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were set to a
      value of unknown (UNK).  Geometry-related keywords for most
      calibration targets were set to UNK.
 
      Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
      the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
      and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
      calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
      earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
      left the target.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second uncertainty between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations and an uncertainty of about one half of a
      second between the clocks on the flyby and impactor spacecraft.
      These improved kernels were included in the DI SPICE data set
      and were used to calculate the geometric parameters in the PDS
      data labels.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
      see the spacecraft clock correlation report provided on the DI
      documentation volume, DIDOC_0001.
 
      The SPICE kernels used to calculated the geometric parameters are
      provided by the SPICE_FILE_NAME keyword in the PDS data labels.  The
      kernels were listed in the order they were loaded into memory for
      processing.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the final version of the kernel files archived in the Deep Impact
    SPICE data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set, version 2.0, replaces version 1.0 that was delivered
    to PDS in December 2005.
 
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation report included on the Deep
    Impact Documentation volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used extensively by the science team.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set was peer-reviewed in April 2007 and was accepted
    for the PDS archive pending resolution of liens (completed in July
    2007).
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  ========================
    There are no gaps in this data set.  All raw images of Tempel 1 that
    were received on the ground were successfully reduced and included
    in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.
    For more information, refer to the notes about image quality map in
    the PDS data label or to the instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      There is a 1/3-pixel, horizontal gap for a clocking phase between
      the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  It was inserted by the
      manufacturer to facilitate the simultaneous upward and downward
      reading of the upper and lower quadrants.  The gap causes a
      10 percent reduction in the sensitivity of the two central rows
      (i.e., one row immediately above the gap and one below it).
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software overwrote the first 50 uncompressed (or 100
      compressed) pixels of first quadrant read out from the instrument
      with an image header.  These header pixels were included in the
      reduced FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary
      dramatically, it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and
      MAXIMUM keywords in the PDS data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL
      in the FITS header) be used to scale an image for display because
      these values exclude the overclock rows and columns located around
      the edge of the image.  The location of the header bytes in a FITS
      image depends on the readout order of the instrument, as discussed
      in the quadrant nomenclature section of the instrument calibration
      paper included on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.
