      Data Set Overview
      =================
 
      This data set includes the complete set of Mars Exploration
      Rover 2 SPICE data files (``kernel files&apos;), which can be
      accessed using SPICE software. The SPICE data contains geometric
      and other ancillary information needed to recover the full value
      of science instrument data. In particular SPICE kernels provide
      spacecraft and planetary ephemerides, instrument mounting
      alignments, spacecraft orientation, spacecraft sequences of
      events, and data needed for relevant time conversions.
 
 
      Data Types (SPICE kernel types)
      ===============================
 
      SPK kernels provide position and velocity information for
      spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and asteroids as well as
      for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument structures. SPK
      files are located under the ``data/spk&apos; directory of this data
      set.
 
      PCK kernels contain certain physical, dynamical and cartographic
      constants for target bodies, such as size and shape
      specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
      meridian. PCK files are located under the ``data/pck&apos; directory
      of this data set.
 
      IK kernels (Instrument description kernels) give descriptive and
      operational data peculiar to a particular scientific instrument,
      such as field-of-view model parameters. IK files are located
      under the ``data/ik&apos; directory of this data set.
 
      CK kernels describe pointing, containing a transformation
      traditionally called the C-matrix which is used to determine
      time-tagged pointing (orientation) angles for a spacecraft
      structure upon which science instruments are mounted. CK files
      are located under the ``data/ck&apos; directory of this data set.
 
      EK (Events) kernels are derived from the integrated sequence of
      events used to produce actual spacecraft commands. EK files are
      located under the ``data/ek&apos; directory of this data set.
 
      LSK (Leapseconds) kernels contain the leapseconds and the values
      of other constants required to perform a transformation between
      Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET). LSK
      files are located under the ``data/lsk&apos; directory of this data
      set.
 
      SCLK (Spacecraft Clock) kernels contain on-board clock
      calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
      time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK.) SCLK files are
      located under the ``data/sclk&apos; directory of this data set.
 
      FK (Frame Definitions) kernels contain information required to
      define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
      inter-connections between these frames and other frames supported
      within the SPICE system. This includes mounting alignment
      information for each instrument. FK files are located under the
      ``data/fk&apos; directory of this data set.
 
 
      Kernel File Details
      ===================
 
      A brief overview of the different types of Stardust kernels
      included in this data set is provided in the
      CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE section of this file while details specific
      to individual files are found in the ``*info.txt&apos; files in the
      corresponding data directory. The most detailed description of
      the data in each file is provided in metadata included inside the
      file -- in the description area of text kernels or in the comment
      area of binary kernels.
 
 
      Software
      ========
 
      The SPICE Toolkit contains software modules needed to read
      SPICE kernel files. SPICELIB software is highly documented
      via internal headers. Additional documentation is available
      in separate ASCII text files called Required Reading files.
      For example, the S- and P- Kernel (SPK) Required Reading File,
      named SPK.REQ, describes use of the SPK kernel file readers
      and contains sample programs.
 
      The latest SPICE Toolkit for a variety of computer platforms such
      as PC, Mac, SUN, etc. is available at the NAIF Node of PDS
      electronically (via anonymous FTP and WWW servers). Refer to
      information in ``software/softinfo.txt&apos; for details regarding
      obtaining this software. Each version of the Toolkit is also
      archived at the NASA National Space Science Data Center.
 
 
      Loading Kernel Files into a SPICE-based Application
      ===================================================
 
      The easiest way to make data from a collection of SPICE kernels
      available to a SPICE-based application is to list these kernels
      in a meta-kernel and load it into the program using the high
      level SPICE data loader routine FURNSH. This data set provides
      such meta-kernel(s) under the ``extras/mk&apos; directory. For more
      information about the Stardust meta-kernel(s), see the file
      ``extras/mk/mkinfo.txt&apos;.
        </data_set_desc>
        <confidence_level_note>
 
      This volume contains SPICE kernel files created during mission
      operations and after mission data reconstruction and analysis.
      Some general information about this collection follows here,
      but the prospective user is also referred to extensive
      descriptions about each file that are stored inside each kernel
      file. These metadata provide detailed information regarding
      the information source from which the data were derived, the
      type of processing applied to the source data, applicability
      of the data, etc. Metadata are located in the ``comment area&apos;
      for binary kernel types (SPK, CK, EK/SEQ), accessible using either
      the COMMNT or SPACIT utility program found in the NAIF Toolkit.
      Metadata are located after ``\begintext&apos; markers within the
      text kernel types (PCK, IK, FK, LSK, SCLK), accessible by
      using any available text file display tool such as a word
      processor, text editor, or the UNIX ``more&apos; or ``cat&apos;
      commands.
 
      In some cases data accuracy information does not exist, or
      may be estimated after mission completion.
 
      Where there are questions about data accuracy or ``confidence&apos;
      not addressed herein the reader is invited to examine subsequent
      SPICE archive releases associated with this data set (if such
      exist), or to contact the NAIF node of the Planetary Data System
      for possible further information.
 
 
      SPK Files
      =========
 
      SP-Kernel files included in this dataset provide the following
      types of position information:
 
        -- cruise trajectory
 
        -- EDL trajectory
 
        -- landing site position relative to the center of Mars
 
        -- positions of the numbered sites along the rover path
 
        -- position of the rover with respect to site(s)
 
        -- relative locations of the rover structures and science
           instruments relative to each other
 
        -- gravity-compensated position of the Microscopic Imager
           touch point relative to the rover reference frame origin
 
        -- ephemerides for planets and Martian satellites
 
      The ``data/spk/spkinfo.txt&apos; file provides names of and/or
      explains naming convention for each of the SPK types provided in
      this data set.
 
      Cruise SPK
      ----------
        This SPK file provide the final reconstructed cruise
        trajectory, from the TECO up to the atmospheric entry point.
        The accuracy of this trajectory is about or better than a
        hundred meters.
 
      EDL SPK
      -------
        This SPK file provide the reconstructed EDL trajectory, from
        the atmospheric entry point to touchdown, computed by Robert C.
        Blanchard, (LARC-D205)[GWU] in 2008. The file&apos;s internal
        comments discuss the accuracy of this trajectory.
 
      Landing Site Position SPK
      -------------------------
        This SPK file provides the location of the landing site on the
        surface of Mars determined by the MER NAV team using post-landing
        radio tracking data. It is based on the final solution that was
        different from the earlier solutions by only a few tens of meters.
 
      Site and Rover Position SPKs
      -----------------------------
        These SPK files provide positions of the numbered sites along
        the rover path and position of the rover relative to these
        sites. Two types of site/rover position SPKs are included in
        this data set: one is based solely on rover telemetry and the
        other is based on the rover telemetry combined with the
        bundle-adjustment data provided by Dr. Ron Li, Ohio State
        University.
 
        Telemetry data used to generate both types of files consisted
        of a combination of the rover position data relative to the
        current site determined by the on-board mobility software and
        the index of the current site. The numbered site positions
        relative to the landing site were computed by combining these
        two inputs and checking for site increment, computing inter-site
        positions based on them, and accumulating these positions from
        the initial site to each individual site. The telemetry was
        extracted from the channelized telemetry stream and from a variety
        of non-channelized telemetry products including image and other
        science products, mobility system products, etc. It provided a
        sufficient number of data points for SPICE SPK interpolation
        technique to correctly represent rover position during
        traverses and at the time when the rover was stationary.
 
        Because the position data that came in telemetry is known to be
        inaccurate -- since the rover did not have an on-board
        capability to take slippage and sliding into account -- the SPK
        files based solely on telemetry ``carry over&apos; these errors. At
        the same time, the data provided in these SPKs are consistent
        with the position information from other telemetry-only based
        products such as image labels.
 
        The second type of SPK attempts to fix the slippage and sliding
        errors by combining the same, relatively complete telemetry
        stream with the sparse data set containing more accurate
        position of the sites and selected rover position between the
        sites determined by Dr. Ron Li by processing the image data.
        Li&apos;s data was used to replace the corresponding telemetry-based
        values, resulting in more accurate but discontinuous rover
        path.
 
      Rover Structures SPK
      --------------------
        This SPK provides relative locations of various rover
        structures and science instruments with respect to the rover
        frame origin and/or each other. The data provided in this file
        were obtained from a number of sources such as the rover
        engineering drawings, IDD calibration report, and latest
        official CAHVOR camera models. When loaded together with the
        IDD, PMA, and HGA orientation CK files this SPK allows one to
        compute positions of these structures and science instruments
        mounted on them with respect to the rover reference frame
        origin.
 
      Gravity-compensated MI Position SPK
      ------------------------------------
        These SPK files provide gravity-compensated position of the
        Microscopic Imager (MI) touch point relative to the rover
        reference frame origin. The position data stored in this SPK
        was determined by the on-board IDD software and was sent to the
        ground in the image product headers.
 
        Although the gravity compensated position provided by this file
        is more accurate than the same position computed using a
        combination of structures SPK and IDD CK, it is correct ONLY at
        the times images were taken. Between the images this SPK will
        return completely bogus position as SPICE does not have a way
        of preventing the SPK subsystem to interpolate between the
        actual data stored in this SPK file even if they are days
        apart.
 
      Planet and Martian Satellite Ephemeris SPKs
      -------------------------------------------
 
        The Martian satellite SPK provided in this data set contains
        ephemeris data for Mars, Phobos, Deimos, Earth and the sun.
        Formal one-sigma accuracy information for Phobos and Deimos are
        reported as follows:
 
          Body         Downtrack      Crosstrack      Radial
                      Uncertainty     Uncertainty   Uncertainty
          ------      -----------     -----------   -----------
          Phobos         15 km           7 km          3 km
          Deimos         30 km          16 km          3 km
 
        Accuracies for Mars-Sun and Mars-Earth directions (positions
        obtained from SPK files) are at the level of 0.001 arc-sec (1
        sigma).
 
        The planet ephemeris SPK file included in this data set
        provides the best current knowledge of the ephemeris of Mars.
 
      CK Files
      ========
 
      C-kernel files included in this dataset provide the following
      types of orientation data:
 
        -- cruise orientation
 
        -- rover orientation during surface operations
 
        -- Pancam Mast Assembly (PMA) orientation
 
        -- Instrument Deployment Device (IDD) orientation
 
        -- High Gain Antenna (HGA) orientation
 
        -- Gravity-compensated orientation of the Microscopic Imager
           relative to the rover reference frame
 
      The ``data/ck/ckinfo.txt&apos; file provides names of and/or explains
      naming convention for each of the CK types provided in this data
      set.
 
      Cruise CK
      ---------
        The cruise orientation CK file provided in this data set was
        created by ``packaging&apos; the complete set of cruise stage
        orientation quaternions extracted from channelized telemetry
        into a type 3 CK file. This file should be used with great
        caution because it allows to compute orientation that is only
        partially correct.
 
        During cruise the spacecraft was spinning about +Z axis at
        approximately 12 rpm at the very beginning of cruise and at 2
        rpm during the rest of cruise. The cruise orientation
        quaternions ``packaged&apos; in this CK file were downlinked
        relatively infrequently (mostly only once every 25 seconds) and
        sometimes with large gaps in coverage (up to a half a day).
        Because of that, when SPICE is reading this file using the
        simple interpolation approach implemented in the type 3 CK, it
        produces incorrect interpolation results with regards to the
        rotation phase. The spin (+Z) axis direction, though, should be
        very close to reality.
 
      Rover Surface Orientation CK
      ----------------------------
        These CK files provide orientation of the rover relative to the
        local level frame. These CKs are based solely on the rover
        orientation quaternions determined by the on-board mobility
        software. On the ground quaternions were extracted from
        channelized telemetry stream and from a variety of
        non-channelized telemetry products including image and other
        science products, mobility system products, etc. The set of
        quaternions contained a sufficient number of data points to
        provide rover orientation during traverses and all science
        observations activities when the rover was stationary.
 
      PMA, IDD, and HGA Orientation CKs
      ---------------------------------
        These CK files provide rotations in the PMA, IDD, and HGA
        joints/gimbals. When combined with the frame definition
        information from the FK files these rotations allow one to
        compute orientation of these structures and science instruments
        mounted on them with respect to the rover reference frame.
        These CKs are based solely on the joint/gimbal angles reported
        by the on-board software. On the ground the angles were
        extracted from channelized telemetry stream and from a variety
        of non-channelized telemetry products including image and other
        science products, mobility system products, etc. The set of
        angles for each structure contained a sufficient number of data
        points to provide orientation during all science and
        engineering activities performed using these structures.
 
      Gravity-Compensated MI Orientation CK
      -------------------------------------
        These CK files provide gravity-compensated orientation of the
        IDD turret frame (co-aligned with the MI frame) relative to the
        rover reference frame. The orientation data stored in this CK
        was determined by the on-board IDD software and sent to the
        ground in the image product headers.
 
        Although the gravity compensated orientation provided by this
        file is more accurate than the same orientation computed using
        IDD CKs, it is provided ONLY at the times of images. This CK
        will not return orientation data for the times between the

      the data set contain values derived from the official CAHVOR
      models used by on-board and ground software. These IK files
      provide specifications for the optical and physical instrument
      parameters and field-of-view size, shape and orientation.
 
      No I-Kernel files for Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer
      (MiniTES), Moessbauer Spectrometer (MB), Alpha Particle X-ray
      Spectrometer (APXS), or Descent Camera (DESCAM) are provided on
      this volume.
 
      The ``data/ik/ikinfo.txt&apos; file provides names of and/or explains
      naming convention for the IK files provided in this data set.
 
 
      SCLK Files
      ==========
 
      Spacecraft Clock Kernel (SCLK) files providing the following
      types of time correlation data are included in this data set:
 
        -- on-board clock correlation SCLK files
 
        -- Hybrid Local Solar Time (HLST) SCLK files
 
      The ``data/sclk/sclkinfo.txt&apos; file provides names of and/or
      explains naming convention for each of the SCLK types provided in
      this data set.
 
      On-board Clock Correlation SCLKs
      --------------------------------
        The SCLK files provide a tabulation of data needed for
        converting time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and
        spacecraft clock time (SCLK). A SPICE SCLK file is made from a
        similar file -- SCLK/SCET file, or SCLKvSCET file -- produced
        by another mission entity. Each newly made SCLK file fully
        replaces the previous SCLK file.
 
        The official on-board correlation SCLK files used in operations
        and included in this data set provide correlation that is
        incorrect in an absolute sense by as much as 20 seconds during
        some periods. The error stems from a combinations of reasons:
        the rover generated too few time correlation packets, the
        specifics of the process used to derive the correlation
        function, and the requirement for backward compatibility
        between correlation versions imposed by the ground system
        tools.
 
        Until an improved version of the on-board clock correlation
        becomes available, this table providing on-board clock time,
        the corresponding UTC computed using the official correlation,
        and the correction, in seconds, to be added to the UTC computed
        using the official correlation, can be used to compensate for
        the error in the UTC time tags attached to the science data
        products:
 
              SCLK                UTC            Correction

      Hybrid Local Solar Time (HLST) SCLK files
      -----------------------------------------
        These SCLK files provide a way of converting between the Hybrid
        Local Solar Time (HLST) time system used during surface
        operations and other time systems. HLST was introduced as a
        replacement of the True Local Solar Time (TLST) because a time
        system with a constant duration of a second was needed for use
        in the planning and sequencing processes. The HLST is
        essentially a linear approximation of the true local time with
        the rate set equal to the mean Mars local second duration and the
        initial reference point set to make sure that HLST deviates from
        TLST by no more that 15 local minutes during the primary
        mission. This approximation continued to deviate from the TLST
        as the surface operations went on, reaching over 50 local
        minutes difference by the end of the first extended mission, as
        illustrated by this table:

      LSK Files
      =========
 
      The leapseconds kernel file provides a tabulation of ``leapseconds&apos;
      and some other terms used in converting time measurements
      between ephemeris time (ET) and Universal Time (UTC). ``Spacecraft
      Event Time&apos; (SCET) is the commonly used name for UTC events
      measured at the spacecraft.
 
      Metadata describing how the LSK data are obtained or computed
      is contained inside the LSK text file. The time conversion
      provided by SPICE LSK files is accurate to approximately
      0.000030 seconds.
 
      The ``data/lsk/lskinfo.txt&apos; file provides names of and/or
      explains naming convention for the LSK files provided in this
      data set.
 
 
      EK Files
      ========
 
      No Event Kernel (EK) files are included in this data set.
