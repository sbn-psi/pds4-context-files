      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This data set contains raw Radio Occultation (ROCC) Original Data
      Records data from the Ulysses (ULY) Solar Corona Experiment (SCE)
      obtained during the ULY Jupiter flyby. The data target the Io
      Plasma Torus (IPT) and cover the period 1992-02-03 11:20 to
      1992-02-09 20:46.
 
      The data set includes 41 NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) Original
      Data Record files (ODR), and documentation. These data are
      obtained from the Radio Science Support group at JPL. They consist
      of time-ordered, high-time resolution Doppler data from special
      radio science receivers (so-called &apos;open loop&apos; data).
 
      The radio downlinks from Ulysses were monitored during the
      passage of the spacecraft through the IPT shortly after closest
      approach to Jupiter. The electron content of the Io torus was
      derived from the dispersive phase shift of the S-band (2.3 GHz)
      signal with respect to the X-band (8.4 GHz) signal. Corrections
      were applied for non-Jovian contributions to the change in
      electron content arising from the interplanetary medium and the
      terrestrial ionosphere. Ulysses&apos; North-to-South encounter
      trajectory was well suited for investigating the global structure
      of the Jovian plasma environment near Io&apos;s orbit, especially its
      latitudinal extent and azimuthal variations. (IPT investigation
      description adapted from [BIRDETAL1993]. For more information
      please refer to the complete paper.)
 
 
      Parameters
      ==========
      Open loop data records (ODRs) contain 8-bit samples of receiver
      output. Each block of (nominally) 500 data samples from each of
      four receivers (or channels) is accompanied a 166 byte header.
      Each ODR is accompanied by a full PDS label which describes both
      the content and format of the file at the bit level. Header
      information includes:
           Date and time of first data sample
           Sample rate and channel assignments
           Receiver local oscillator (POCA) frequency
           Attenuator settings
           RMS voltages at several stages in the receiving chain
 
      Channel assignments are as follows:
        Channel 1     X-RCP (X-band right circularly polarized)
        Channel 2     S-RCP (S-band right circularly polarized)
        Channel 3     X-LCP (X-band left circularly polarized)
        Channel 4     S-LCP (S-band left circularly polarized)
 
      The ODR is described by a Software Interface Specification (SIS),
      included as RSC1110A.ASC in the DOCUMENT/RSC1110A directory of
      this volume.
 
 
      Processing
      ==========
      Open loop data (ODRs) are not edited or otherwise processed before
      being incorporated into this archive. A 32-byte label at the
      beginning of each ODR tape is not included in the data file; it
      gives the software version of the data taking equipment and is
      saved instead in the PDS label that accompanies the data file.
 
 
      Data
      ====
      ODRs were generated at stations of the NASA Deep Space Network
      (DSN) and were distributed on 6250 bpi tape. Those tapes have been
      copied to disk files, defined as PDS TABLE Objects, and archived
      on this DVD-WO volume. Ancillary data to support analysis are
      provided in the GEOMETRY, and DOCUMENT directories.
 
      A nominal ODR contains 36000 records, each record having 166 bytes
      of header data and 2000 bytes of 8-bit sample data.
 
      On this volume ODR files have names of the form &apos;ydddhhmm.ODR&apos;
      where &apos;y&apos; gives the least significant digit of the year, &apos;ddd&apos; is
      the 3-digit day-of-year, &apos;hh&apos; is the 2-digit hour, and &apos;mm&apos; is the
      2-digit minute on which data acquisition for the file began.
 
      Each ODR data file is accompanied by a full PDS detached label
      with name &apos;ydddhhmm.LBL&apos; which completely describes the contents
      of the ODR file. The format and contents are also described in
      RSC1110A.ASC in the DOCUMENT/RSC1110A directory of this archival
      volume.
 
 
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      For each ODR, there is a set of ancillary files needed for
      analysis. These are stored in the DOCUMENT and GEOMETRY
      directories, as appropriate.
 
        Observing Geometry
        ------------------
        A NAIF (PDS Navigation and Ancillary Information) &apos;transfer&apos;
        format SPK files is provided for the period 1992-01-05 to
        1995-10-31. This file contains the positions of Ulysses,
        Jupiter, Earth, the Sun, and Jupiter&apos;s four Galilean satellites
        (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) in data modules that can be
        used readily with NAIF Toolkit software. This &apos;transfer&apos; format
        SPK file (ULY92106.XSP) is located in the GEOMETRY directory.
        The XSP file is accompanied by a detached PDS label
        (ULY92106.LBL) which describes some of the SPK file&apos;s
        characteristics.
 
        Before using &apos;transfer&apos; NAIF files, the user should convert
        ASCII carriage-return line-feed delimiters on each record to the
        default delimiter for text files on the local system, then use
        the NAIF utility SPACIT to convert the archival file to local
        binary.
 
        An overview of the SPICE data system can be found in SPICE.TXT
        located in the DOCUMENT directory of this volume.
 
        For additional information on acquiring, installing, and using
        SPICE data or software please contact the PDS NAIF node:

        Documentation
        -------------
        A copy of a document [RSC-11-10A] describing the format of the
        Ulysses ODR data contained on this volume is provided in the
        DOCUMENT/RSC1110A directory.
 
 
      Coordinate System
      =================
      SPK ephemeris files and quaternion files were produced for the
      J2000 inertial reference frame. SPICE reader routines may be used
      to convert these to other coordinate systems.
 
      Other data types are not dependent on definition of a coordinate
      system.
 
 
      Software
      ========
      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing these data has been
      developed at Stanford University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
      and other institutions. Because parsing must be done at the bit
      level, adaptation of the software to other platforms is not always
      easy. No software has been prepared for general distribution, and
      none is included with this archive. Users should refer to the PDS
      labels and Software Interface Specifications
      (/DOCUMENT/RSC1110A/RSC1110A.ASC) for detailed information on file
      formats before writing their own software.
 
 
      Media/Format
      ============
      This archival data set is written on DVD-R media using a Pioneer
      DVR-A03 recorder (DVD-R for General, 650 nm wavelength). The DVD-R
      volume conforms to ISO 9660 standards.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
 
      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      The ODR data files have been tested by being read, a histogram
      computed of sample values, time-averaged power spectra derived
      from the samples, and one-second averages generated of sample
      power. Data quality concerns discovered in this process are listed
      the &apos;Data Coverage and Quality&apos; section below.
 
 
      Review
      ======
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data set,
      the archive was distributed to both PDS and non-PDS personnel,
      including the PDS Radio Science advisor, for preliminary review.
 
 
      Data Coverage and Quality

      General data quality issues:
 
      Ulysses&apos; S-band downlink is elliptically polarized with an axial
      ratio of approximately 2:1. While, with a 2:1 axial ratio, a
      difference of 10 dB might be expected between the signal-to-noise
      ratios (SNR) of the S-band LCP and RCP, the actual difference is
      around 15 dB. This deviation from the expected difference may be
      attributed to the fact that the value of 2:1 used for the axial
      ratio is only approximate.
 
      There appears to be a broad noise apron around the carrier
      (approx. 10 dB and extending to +/-100 Hz) each time a signal is
      present.
 
      Specific data quality issues:
 
        The S-band downlink was started 1992-02-05 19:44 (DOY 36). As a
        result there is no signal on channels 2 and 4 on days 34 and 35.
