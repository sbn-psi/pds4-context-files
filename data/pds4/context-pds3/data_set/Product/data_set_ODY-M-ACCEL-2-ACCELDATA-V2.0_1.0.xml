    Data Set Overview
    =================
      All level zero accelerometer data are packaged by periapsis number for
      each aerobraking orbit.  Each orbit is identified by a file with name Pyyy
      where where &apos;yyy&apos; is the three digit periapsis number. Level 0
      accelerometer data are provided every 1.0 seconds during an interval of
      time that generally assures 60 seconds of data before and after the
      spacecraft passes through the 170 km altitude above the surface of Mars.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      Acceleration:      Units = m/s^2
                           Sampling Interval = 1 seconds
      Quaternions:         Units = dimensionless
                           Sampling Interval = 1 second
      Body rates:        Units = rad/s
                           Sampling Interval = 1 second
      Thruster on-times:   Units = sec (cumulative time thruster has fired)
                           Sampling Interval = various
      Orbital elements:    Units = various
                           Sampling Interval = once per orbit
 
 
    Data
    ====
      For each orbit, Level 0 data consist of four arrays in four files in
      folder Pyyy.  The array in &apos;ACCEL.TAB&apos; is n-by-4 in size, where n is the
      number of seconds of data received during the aerobraking pass.  Column 1
      contains the time in UTC and follows the PDS format YYYY-DDDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
      where YYYY = four digit year, DDD = day of year, HH = hour, MM = minute,
      and SS.SSS = seconds.  T is a separator for date and time and the Z is the
      UTC Z.  Column 2-4 contain the 1.0 second acceleration for the second
      beginning at the time stamp. The body y direction in approximately into
      the wind.
 
      The array in &apos;RATEQUAT.TAB&apos; is n-by-8 in size.  Column 1 is the time
      corresponding to the filtered rates and quaternions in the same UTC format
      as described for the acceleration above.  Columns 2-4 contain the angular
      rates about the x, y and z axes respectively.  Columns 5-8 contain the
      quaternions.
 
      The third file, &apos;THRUSTER.TAB&apos;, is a k-by-4 array.  The first column is
      time       as described above.  The next 4 columns are the cumulative
      reading of how long each thruster has been fired during the mission.
      Column two corresponds to thruster number one, column 3 with thruster 2,
      and so on.
 
      The fourth file, &apos;ORBELEM.TAB&apos;, is a 1-by-6 array of osculating elements
      at       periapsis in the order semi-major axis (km), eccentricity,
      inclination (radians), longitude of the ascending node (radians), argument
      of periapsis (radians), and universal time of periapsis (seconds past
      J2000).
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Acceleration and rates are given in the MRO body system with the y-axis
      along the centerline of the bus, positive z on the same side of the bus as
      the high gain antenna and x completing the right hand system, ref.
      AACSDEFN. The quaternions define the orientation of the body axes with
      respect to the IAU Mars Centered Mars Equatorial at Time of Jan 1, 2000
      12:00.  Orbital elements are given relative to the IAU system.
 
 
    Timing
    ======
      The times in the data sets are UTC. For orbit calculations, ephemeris time
      ws converted to UTC using the current ET-UTC conversion. No attempt was
      made during operations to synchronize the data types.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
 
    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      After the effects of rate filtering are included (see Limitations below),
      the confidence level for the rate and quaternion data is sufficient for
      reducing almost all the accelerometer data to the noise level. The only
      exception is during a thruster firing which can introduce spikes in the
      acceleration above the noise level. Accelerometer bias clearly drifts with
      temperature during the pass, but the change is well below the noise level
      and no attempt was made to improve the calibration.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      All of the data types included in the level 0 product are utilized by the
      MRO operations to monitor the health of the spacecraft.  These data are
      reviewed in near real time to assure ODY performance.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      Data coverage during an aerobraking pass varied as the orbital
      eccentricity decreased. Except for a few orbits, data were received
      throughout the mission for a sufficient time to cover the altitude range
      from periapsis to an altitude of 250 km.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      Version 0 data are based on operational processing of the data. No attempt
      has been made to eliminate effects due to thruster firing, center of mass
      location errors, or time lags between various data streams.
