Data Set Overview
=================
 
    The PIA data was acquired in four modes of data
    compression, termed mode 0 (the least compressed),
    and modes 1, 2, and 3, each with increasing degrees
    of compression.  With each spectrum are a PIA
    assigned sequence number and event numbers, a unique
    ID-number, instrument settings, and the relative
    approach time.  The PIA time is a 16-bit counter that
    starts with zero after switch-on.  As the Spacecraft
    Time Signal (STS) is used to reset the internal PIA
    time counter, the TIM highest possible value is 48960
    counts.  STS-pulses are given after the transimssion
    of 256 formats.  This results for format F1/F2 and
    high bitrate (46080 bps) in 5802.67 s.  (= 256
    formats * 64 frames * 2040 bytes * 8 bit/byte/46080
    bps) The time resolution is DTIM = 1/ (138240 HZ
    /2**14 ) = 0.1185 s.  Each STS defines the time for
    an event with TIM = 0.  Therefore, SCET = GRT(STS) +
    (TIM * DTIM) - propogation delay (8:00.1 sec).  where
    SCET = Spacecraft Event Time, GRT = Ground Reception
    Time.  The table below lists important GRT for the
    Encounter (Mar 13-14).

     The data for these files were received as a series
    of FITS files, each of which consisted of spectra of
    a single mode.  Amplitude-triggered samples in the
    spectra were indicated by an &apos;X&apos; following the
    sample.  The files have been regrouped according to
    Mode and presented as a binary array with a separate
    ASCII index table.
 
 
    Reformatting at SBN
 
     The following changes were made to the data:
 
    o Flagged amplitudes, followed by an &apos;X&apos; in the text
    file, were indicated in the binary file as a
    additional byte set equal to 1 for flagged
    amplitudes, 0 otherwise.  This is the same system
    used for the IKI VEGA submissions.
 
 
    Known Anomalies/Problems:
 
 
     o In the received FITS file numbered 40, the final
    spectrum in the file (sequence number 2991, event
    number 46698, time 48110) was truncated.  It is not
    clear if only this last spectrum was lost or if other
    spectra might have followed since the NAXIS1 and
    NAXIS2 values from the header indicate more data.
     The incomplete spectrum was omitted entirely from
    the binary table.
 
     o Two mode 1 spectra were found which contained an
    odd number of bytes in the spectrum.  In mode 1 the
    number of bytes should be even, as each sample in the
    spectrum consists of a time sample byte and an
    amplitude sample byte.  In these cases the single
    byte was assumed to be a time value and a null
    amplitude byte was appended to the spectrum.
 
 
     o In working with these files it was noted that many
    spectra exhibited strange features, including:
 
    - parameter values but no spectrum bytes (i.e.,
    zero-length spectra)
 
    - repeating time values of 255 (the maximum possible
    time)
 
    - repeating amplitude values of 127 (the maximum
    possible)
 
    - repeating values of 32 (ASCII code for blank)
 
    o There was a failure in the instrument during the
    fly-by.  The following is taken directly from the
    FITS file header which was attached to the text
    files:
 
    During the actual flyby two out of six
    multiplier-amplifiers failed, yielding incorrect
    amplitude information in the mass spectra channel; to
    obtain partial correction for amplitude, use F(a),
    where
 
    F(0)       = 0           F(20)       = 49
    F(1...4)   = a*2 + 21    F(21)       = 52
    F(5...8)   = a + 25      F(22)       = 57
    F(9...14)  = a + 26      F(23...25)  = 3*(a-23) + 62
    F(15,16)   = a + 27      F(26...83)  = a + 4a
    F(17...19) = a + 2b      F(84...127) = 128
 
NOTE: Despite this correction the amplitude ranges 1...22 and
      around 51...65 are incomplete.
