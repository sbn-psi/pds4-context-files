  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains version 2.0 of raw calibration images acquired
    by the Medium Resolution Visible CCD (MRI) from 04 October 2007 through
    28 November 2010 during the EPOCh, 103P/Hartley 2 Encounter, and cruise
    phases of the EPOXI mission.  This dataset supersedes version 1.0 which
    contained raw calibration only through July 2010.
 
    The purpose of these data are to monitor the MRI CCD and improve its
    calibration as needed.  Therefore EPOXI calibration activities for
    the instrument generally followed those designed for Deep Impact.
    For example standard calibration targets continue to include the
    Moon, 16 Cyg A, 47 Tuc, Achernar, Beta Hyi, Canopus, HD 60753,
    HD 79447, NGC 3114, NGC 7027, Vega, sky frames, stim lamp frames,
    and dark frames.  The Deep Impact calibration pipeline was the
    foundation for EPOXI until improvements were implemented for the
    Hartley 2 encounter as described in the Hartley 2 calibration summary
    report located in the DOCUMENT directory.  For a detailed discussion
    of how the instruments were calibrated for EPOXI see Klaasen, et al.
    (2011, in preparation) [KLAASENETAL2011].  The Deep Impact instrument
    calibration is described by Klaasen, et al. (2008)[KLAASENETAL2006]
    and Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].
 
    A list of the calibration activities relevant to this dataset is
    provided below and a description of each activity follows.  The EPOXI
    in-flight calibrations summary chart in the DOCUMENT directory provides
    a quick-look at the activities.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      Instrument Checkout:  On 4 October 2007, the three science instruments
        were turned on for the first time in more than two years.  Sky
        frames acquired by the MRI CCD confirmed the mechanical components
        such as the shutter and filter wheel were functioning.  The
        instrument exhibited nominal behavior of background levels.
 
      EPOCh Photometry Test:  On 4-9 November 2007, EPOCh photometry tests
        were performed for the HRIV instrument to check pointing and
        photometric stability.  One MRI frame of the target, HD 80607, was
        acquired.
 
      Lunar Calibration:  On 29 December 2007 as the spacecraft approached
        Earth, the three science instruments used the Moon as a target to
        acquire data for recalibration purposes (radiometry and scattered
        light).
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  On 9 January 2008, the first of the
        standard cruise calibrations for the three science instruments was
        performed.  The calibration sequence included observations of
        several standard stars, both solar analogs and hot stars with few
        absorption lines in their spectra for absolute calibration of all
        instruments, a stellar cluster for checking geometric distortion in
        the cameras, and a planetary nebula for checking the wavelength
        calibration of the spectrometer.  This sequence was designed such
        that it could be rerun, with few if any changes, after completion of
        the EPOCh observations and then again just before and just after the
        observing program for comet 103P/Hartley 2.  Good radiometry,
        geometric, and linearity data were obtained.
 
      HRII Subframe Gain Calibration:  On 26 January 2009, an HRII subframe
        gain calibration was conducted to observe differences in the IR
        spectrometer signal response rates when observing an external
        radiance source to differentiate between gain and offset effects
        when using the various subframe modes.  The test was performed by
        scanning the spectrometer across the moon (cross slit) at multiple
        speeds with various subframe modes while the HRI telescope barrel
        was warm.  MRI frames were acquired to provide context for the
        IR scans.
 
      HRII Lunar Radiometry and Flats:  On 1-2 June 2009, the HRII
        spectrometer acquired a series of north/south scans (cross slit)
        of the moon for lunar radiometry and east/west scans along IR slit
        for flats. These data were the best obtained to date for the
        purpose of generating flat fields for the IR spectrometer.  MRI
        frames were acquired to provide context for the IR scans.
 
      HRII Lunar Radiometry and Antisat Filter:  On 9 June 2009, the HRII
        spectrometer imaged the moon using north/south scans (cross slit)
        to better characterize the effects of the anti-saturation filter
        in the IR spectra.  MRI frames were acquired to provide context
        for the IR scans.
 
      Checkout after HRI Turnoff:  Before repeating the Earth South Pole
        observation, a standard imaging checkout of the HRII, HRIV, and MRI
        instruments was performed after HRI was powered up on 30 September
        2009.  The data included HRII spectra of the sky.
 
      HRII Radiometric Cal #1 (Beta Hyi):  From 13 October to 24 October
        2009, the HRII spectrometer repeatedly scanned the star Beta Hyi to
        improve the radiometric calibration for that instrument.  MRI
        frames were acquired to provide context for the IR scans.
 
      HRII Lunar Flats/Radiometric Cal #1 and #2:  On 05 and 12 December
        2009 as the spacecraft approached Earth, the IR spectrometer made
        north/south scans of the moon for radiometry and east/west scans
        along the slit for lunar flats and a radiometric calibration.
        MRI frames were acquired to provide context for the IR scans.
 
      HRII Lunar South Pole Radiometry:  On 18 December 2009, about 10
        days before the distant flyby of Earth the IR spectrometer made
        north/south scans of the lunar south pole for radiometric analysis.
        MRI frames were acquired to provide context for the IR scans.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full, standard cruise calibration
        for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was completed on 16 February 2010.  The
        sequence was very similar to that used for the standard cruise
        calibrations in 2008.
 
      HRII Radiometric Cal #2 (Beta Hyi):  From 03-17 May 2010, the HRII
        spectrometer repeatedly scanned the star Beta Hyi to improve the
        radiometric calibration for that instrument.  MRI frames were
        acquired to provide context for the IR scans.
 
      MRI Dosido Fast Slew Test:  On 12 July 2010, the MRI Dosido fast slew
        sequence involved a test of the observing strategy planned from 8
        days to 1 day before the Hartley 2 encounter that included periods
        during which the spacecraft attitude was maneuvered once per hour
        between the Earth downlink attitude and the comet viewing attitude.
        The spacecraft was slewed at a high rate between these two
        attitudes, and the Deep Space Network was required to lockup on the
        downlink quickly every hour.  MRI images of random space were taken
        each hour at the comet viewing attitude as they will be during the
        actual encounter sequence in early November 2010.
 
      Pre-Encounter Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full, standard cruise
        calibration for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was performed on 28-29
        September 2010.  The sequence was very similar to that used
        earlier in 2010.
 
      Darks for E-34 Days to E+12 Days:  The imaging sequences that were
        executed from 01 October through 16 November 2010 for the encounter
        of Hartley 2 included MRI dark frames for background and stripe
        removal analyses.
 
      Post-Encounter Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full post-encounter
        standard cruise calibration for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was performed
        on 27-28 November 2010.  The sequence was nearly identical to the
        pre-encounter calibration performed in September.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and the
    image quality map are described in the EPOXI SIS document.  The SDC
    did not apply any type of correction or decompression algorithm to the
    raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw MRI image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte of eight bit flags to indicate the quality of
      each pixel in the primary image.  The data label provides a short
      description of each bit.  For more information about the FITS primary
      image and its extension or for examples of how to access and use the
      quality flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a PDS data label.  Many values in a label were extracted from
      FITS image header keywords which are defined in the document
      EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and EPOXI
      documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V3.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      MVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;MV&apos; identifies the MRI
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 32
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 1000000, the
      first FITS file name would be MV07122918_1000000_001.FIT and the last
      would be MV07122918_1000000_032.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      For some MRI calibration frames the raw data numbers were
      compressed on board the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table
      then downlinked, processed, and archived in the same format.  A
      compressed image is identified by the value &apos;COMPRESSED&apos; in the
      COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE keyword in the data labels or the COMPRESS
      keyword in the FITS headers.  See the EPOXI SIS and EPOXI Hartley 2
      Calibration Pipeline Summary documents as well as Klaasen, et al.
      (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006] for more information.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of MRI to the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the instrument alignment section of the EPOXI SIS
      document or Klaasen, et al. (2011) [KLAASENETAL2011].

    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  NAIF used these kernels to produce the
    EPOXI SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The FITS files in this dataset were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project and were used extensively by the science teams to improve
    the calibration of instrument.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset, Version 2.0, was peer reviewed and certified for
    scientific use on 15 August 2011.  It supersedes Version 1.0
    which contained data only from October 2007 through July 2010.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All calibration
    observations received on the ground were processed and included in this
    dataset.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this dataset
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However the
      latest SCLK (science version 84) applied to the Hartley 2 encounter
      data is good to within 0.01 seconds for converting the spacecraft
      timestamps to ephemeris time for observations acquired around
      closest approach.  Please note that the SCLK (version 65) used to
      compute UTC values and geometry for calibration data acquired from
      January 2009 through July 2010 has known discontinuities of up to a
      second.  Those discontinuities have been corrected in the latest
      SCLK, science version 84, applied to Hartley data.
 
      The mission operations team has figured out how to correct raw clock
      correlation data for the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft to allow
      timing fits that are accurate to well under the sub-second level as
      evidenced by the 0.01-second accuracy around the time the Hartley 2
      encounter.  The EPOXI project plans to use this method to generate a
      complete and highly accurate set of UTC correlations for the flyby
      spacecraft since the launch, resulting in a future version of a SCLK
      kernel that will retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep
      Impact and EPOXI data.  When this kernel is available, it will be
      added to the SPICE datasets for the two missions and posted on the
      NAIF/SPICE web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.  The EPOXI
      project will provide more precise times for archived data as time
      and funding permit.
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the HRIV CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are 1/6 of a pixel
      smaller vertically than a normal row.  Therefore, reconstructed
      images, which have uniform row spacing, have a 1/3-pixel extension
      introduced at the center of the array.  Thus for two features on
      either side of the midpoint line, the vertical component of the
      actual angular separation between those features is one-third of a
      pixel less than their measured difference in vertical pixels in the
      image.  As for all geometric distortions, correction of this
      distortion will require resampling of the image and an attendant
      loss in spatial resolution.  The standard pipeline process does
      not perform this correction so as to preserve the best spatial
      resolution.
 
      The two 1/6-pixel narrower central rows collect only 5/6 of the
      charge of a normal row.  This effect is corrected by the flat-field
      division for calibrated science images so that the pixels in these
      rows have the correct scene radiance assigned to them.  However,
      point-source or disk-integrated photometric measurements using
      aperture photometry areas that include these central rows will be
      slightly distorted unless special adjustments are made.  For
      example, the aperture photometry process for comet 9P/Tempel 1 added
      an extra 1/6-pixel worth of signal to the to the pixels in each of
      these two rows in the reconstructed, calibrated images as described
      in Appendix A of Belton, et al., (2011) [BELTONETAL2011].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
