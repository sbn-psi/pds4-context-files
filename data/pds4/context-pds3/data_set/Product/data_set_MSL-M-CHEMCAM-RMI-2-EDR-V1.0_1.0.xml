  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set consists of all the uncalibrated data collected by the
    Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) camera. The ChemCam remote micro-imager (RMI)
    provides high resolution images primarily to give the morphological
    context for the LIBS analysis points, though it can also be used for
    imaging other features on Mars. It consists of a 1024 x 1024 pixel camera
    with a field of view of ~20 mrad. Its resolution is approximately 100
    micro-radians. The RMI images a broad spectral band by picking off about
    10% of the light from the ChemCam telescope. Having a narrow depth of
    focus, it uses an autofocus algorithm to acquire targets with in ~20 m,
    and can be focused manually to infinity. Images can be compressed without
    loss or with a lossy algorithm, and can be downlinked as thumbnails or
    subframes.
 
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
     RMI Imaging: The imager software inherited from Rosetta includes
     autoexposure algorithms, with typically four different exposures made,
     and the best image is kept. For a typical rock analysis scenario a
     full 1024x1024 pixel image is taken prior to LIBS analysis, and an
     image of only the analysis spot (e.g., 128x128) is taken subsequent to
     analysis. While LIBS and RMI will be used frequently together, there
     will be numerous times when RMI will be used separately, such as to
     provide close-up images to support arm-mounted experiments, or provide
     images of very distant objects.
 
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    This data set uses the Committee On Data Management And
    Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system. The EDRs are to be
    reconstructed from &apos;Level 1&apos; or &apos;Raw Data&apos;, which are the
    telemetry packets within the project specific Standard Formatted Data
    Unit (SFDU) record.
 
    CHEMCAM EDRs were generated by the MIPL (Multimission Image Processing
    Laboratory) at JPL under the Operation Products Generation Subsystem.
    The EDRs are raw uncalibrated data reconstructed from telemetry data
    products and formatted according to the Camera EDR/RDR Software Interface
    Specification. Meta-data acquired from the telemetry data headers
    and a meta-data database were used to propagate the PDS label.
 
    RDRs will be produced in succession by the ChemCam Team and formatted
    according to this SIS, the RDR data product will be placed into FEI for
    distribution.
 
 
  Data
  ====
     The data are stored in multiple data files and have been organized by
     data products.
 
     For RMI the data product consists of the following:
     Ancillary Data which includes sclk, tempertures and command parameteres
     and arguments.
     SOH Data Before and after the image.
     Auto Focus data if the Autofocus was used.
     Image Science Data
     As well as Command Reply data for each DPO.
 
     An attached PDL Label describes the content of the data file and
     format of the data can be found in referenced .FMT files.
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
     Most of the ancillary data needed can be found in the data it self or
     in the label portion of the EDR.  Also included will be an Ancillary
     DPO.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    High-level description of confidence level (reliability, accuracy,
      completeness, etc.)
 
 
 
  Review
  ======
      Describe review processes which the data have undergone, including the
      PDS Peer review.
 
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
     This is a good place to mention known data gaps and any null values or
      invalid data flags which might be included.

  Limitations
  ===========
      Any caveats which seem appropriate for potential users, including
      related datasets needed for interpretation or special software
      considerations.
