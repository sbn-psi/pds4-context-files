    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Third Cassini Gravitational Wave Experiment (GWE3) Raw Data
      Archive is a time-ordered collection of radio science raw data
      acquired during the Space Science subphase of the Cassini mission.
      The DATA_SET_ID &apos;CO-X-RSS-1-GWE3-V1.0&apos; includes the following
      components:
          Instrument host (i.e., &apos;CO&apos; for CASSINI ORBITER)
          Target (i.e., &apos;X&apos; for Other)
          Instrument (i.e., &apos;RSS&apos; for Radio Science Subsystem)
          Data processing level number (i.e., &apos;1&apos;)
          Description (i.e., &apos;GWE3&apos;)
          Version number (i.e., &apos;V1.0&apos;)
 
      Two types of measurements were obtained; these are known
      as closed-loop and open-loop recordings.  The closed-loop
      system uses a phase-lock loop in the receiver to track the
      downlink signal, reporting both amplitude and frequency 10
      times per second.  In the open-loop system, the signal is
      simply converted to a baseband frequency range; the entire
      passband is sampled and recorded at 1000 samples per second.
 
      The data set includes three primary data types.  Tracking and
      Navigation Service Data Files (TNFs) are are the most primitive (and
      most voluminous) product of the closed-loop system. Orbit Data Files
      (ODFs) are compressed versions of TNFs, specifically targeted to
      spacecraft navigators and scientists interested in gravity fields.
      Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are the primary data type from
      the open-loop system.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The TNF is the primary output from the Cassini closed-loop system.
      Each TNF in the data set is accompanied by a full PDS label which
      defines both the content and the format (at the bit level) of the
      file.  TNF data fields include:
           High- or low-rate Doppler
           Range
           Uplink frequencies (ramps)
           Differential Range vs Integrated Doppler (DRVID)
           Allan deviation
           Smoothed noise
      Other information in TNF data records includes sample date and
      time; spacecraft ID; ground station and its configuration;
      status flags and values reported by various ground systems;
      calibration values, noise estimates, and tolerances (station
      delay, transmitter power, etc.); and signal strength.
 
      The ODF is a compressed version of the TNF.  It contains the most
      important information (range, Doppler and frequency ramps) needed by
      spacecraft navigators, and investigators interested in determining
      gravitational fields.  Each ODF is accompanied by a full PDS label
      which describes both the content and format of the associated file.
      ODF data fields include:
           One-way Doppler (Hertz)
           Two-way Doppler (Hertz)
           Three-way Doppler (Hertz)
           SRA planetary operational discrete spectrum range (range
                units)
 
      The Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are the primary output
      from the Cassini open-loop system and they contain 16-bit samples
      of receiver output. Each RSR file is accompanied by a full PDS label
      which describes both the content and format of the file at the
      bit level.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      The open-loop Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files are screened for
      gaps.  No gaps were found in the RSR files for GWE3.
 
      TNFs are screened for data/contents problems, which are corrected
      if/as possible before the files are released by the JPL multimission
      Radio Metric Data Conditioning Team (RMDCT).
 
      ODFs are constructed from subsets of TNF data by the RMDCT.
 
      The closed-loop Tracking and Navigation Service Files (TNFs)
      for Cassini GWE3 are constructed so that each file contains
      the data for a single day. However, the closed-loop Orbit Data
      Files (ODFs) for Cassini GWE3 are constructed to contain the
      data for a single station pass. That is, there are nominally three
      ODFs for each day of the experiment: one for Glodstone (DSS-25),
      one for Madrid, and one for Canberra. Each ODF extends from a
      station&apos;s BOT through its EOT.
 
 
    Primary Data
    ============
      The primary data are stored on DVD volumes in subdirectories TNF,
      ODF, and RSR in per-day directories GWE3_ddd (where ddd specifies
      the day of year based on the start time of the data). Users should
      refer to the INDEX/CUMINDEX.TAB listing to locate primary data files.
 
      TNFs are stored in the TNF directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.TNF,
      where &apos;sss&apos; is the sequence/orbit id (e.g., C40), &apos;tt&apos; is the
      target id (e.g., EA),&apos;aa&apos; is the activity/experiment id (e.g., GW),
      &apos;yyyy_ddd_hhmm&apos; is the date and time for the start of included data
      (e.g., 2003_318_0000), &apos;xuu&apos; is the transmitter band and uplink
      station (e.g., MMM, for multiple transmitter bands (i.e., X and K)
      and multiple uplink stations (i.e., 25, 45 and 65) ), &apos;w&apos; is the
      ground mode or &apos;way&apos; (e.g., M for multiple ground modes (i.e.,
      2-way and 3-way) and Vn is the file version number (e.g., V0).
      The PDS label has file name sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.LBL.
      The typical TNF contains about 100 Mbytes.
 
      ODFs are stored in the ODF directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.ODF.
      The PDS label has file name sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuuwVn.LBL.
      The typical ODF contains about 3 Mbytes.
 
      RSR files are stored in the RSR directory on archival volumes.
      File names are of the form sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuudrrD.rcs,
      where &apos;drr&apos; is the downlink band and receiving station (e.g., K25)
      and &apos;rcs&apos; is the RSR, channel and subchannel that were used to
      collect the data (e.g., 1A1). The PDS label has file name
      sssttaayyyy_ddd_hhmmxuudrrD.LBL. The typical RSR contains from
      about 30 Mbytes to about 165 Mbytes depending on Doppler mode and
      station (i.e., track duration).
 
 
    Secondary Data
    ==============
      Secondary data are needed for proper analysis and interpretation
      of the radio data (file types TNF, ODF, and RSR). Secondary data
      that cover a time span of 24 hours or less are stored in
      subdirectories of GWE3_ddd (i.e., 158, 515, PD1, PD2 and TLM).
      Secondary data that cover a time span greater than 24 hours are
      provided in subdirectories CKF, EOP, ION, SPK and TRO in the
      GWE3_ANCILLARY directory. Users should refer to the
      INDEX/CUMINDEX.TAB listing to locate secondary data files.

    Files in the CALIB Directory
    =============================
       The CALIB directory contains a Leapsecond kernel file, a Spacecraft
       Clock Conversion file, and a Boresight Calibration Report. All files
       in the CALIB directory are ASCII text files with variable length
       records delimited by ASCII carriage-return line-feed pairs. All file
       names in this directory contain the string &apos;yymmdd&apos;, where yy, mm,
       dd indicate the year, month and day of the file creation.
 
       Leapsecond kernel files are a record of leap seconds (past and
       predicted) that allow proper conversion between ephemeris time
       and UTC. File names are of the form:
 
                 LSK_yymmdd.TLS
 
       Each file LSK_yymmdd.TLS is accompanied by a PDS detached minimal
       label with name LSK_yymmdd.LBL.
 
       Spacecraft Clock Conversion files allow time measured by the
       spacecraft clock to be converted to other time systems (e.g.,
       ephemeris time or UTC). File names are of the form:
 
                 TSC_yymmdd.SCK
 
       Each file TSC_yymmdd.SCK is accompanied by a PDS detached minimal
       label with name TSC_yymmdd.LBL.
 
       The Boresight Calibration Reports are produced by the Radio Science
       Systems Group (RSSG) at JPL.  The naming convention for these files
       is:
 
       BORESIGHT_yymmdd.TXT
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      SPK files are produced in the J2000 inertial
      reference frame. Other data types are not dependent on any
      definition of a coordinate system.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing data such as
      these has been developed at JPL and elsewhere. Because such
      software must usually operate at the bit-level and is written
      for a narrow range of platforms, it is unsuitable for
      general distribution. As such, no software is included with
      this archival data set.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The archival data set is written on DVD-R media. The DVD-R volumes

    Overview
    ========
      In general, this is a good data set.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the Cassini Radio Science
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      The data are contained in five volumes (DVDs).
      The table below lists the five volumes and their respective
      contents.
 
 
      VOLUME_ID      Start Date           End Date
      ---------  ------------------- -------------------
      CORS_0081  2003-11-10 (03/314) 2003-11-13 (03/317)
      CORS_0082  2003-11-14 (03/318) 2003-11-17 (03/321)
      CORS_0083  2003-11-18 (03/322) 2003-11-21 (03/325)
      CORS_0084  2003-11-22 (03/326) 2003-11-25 (03/329)
      CORS_0085  2003-11-26 (03/330) 2003-11-29 (03/333)
 
     The ODFs in this data set contain only X-band data.
 
     There are no TNF data for DOY 317, 323 and 333.
 
     The Ka-band Translator (KAT) on the Cassini spacecraft was not
     functioning properly during the GWE3. Thus, there are no
     Ka-Up/Ka-down data in this data set.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      The limitations in this data set follow from the quality of
      the execution, which is described above under Data Coverage
      and Quality.
