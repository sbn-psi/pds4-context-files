      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This data set contains images of the Deep Space 1 target, comet
      19P/Borrelly, and derived photometry from five consecutive nights
      of observing over 28 July - 1 August 2000.  The observations were
      made using the 1.5m telescope of the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
      Observatory using the CFCCD camera mounted at the f/7.5 focus.
      The detector used was a Tek2K, yielding a plate scale of 0.4334
      arcseconds/pixel.  The photometric and lightcurve results were
      presented in Mueller and Samarasinha (2002) [MUELLER&amp;SAMARAS2002].
 
 
      Parameters
      ==========
      The photometry, supplied as a single flat ASCII table, provides
      time, absolute R magnitude and an error bar for each image in
      the data set.  Observational parameters for each image are
      incorporated into the PDS labels and FITS headers supplied with
      the data.
 
 
      Processing
      ==========
      The following description was extracted from Mueller and
      Samarasinha (2002).  Additional details are provided in the
      published paper.
 
      All observations were made using a standard, broadband R
      filter.  Integration time was limited to avoid tailing the
      comet image past the seeing disk.  The IRAF package was
      used to bias-subtract and flat-field the images.  Landolt
      stars (SA 112) were used for absolute calibration of the
      data from night four.  Overlapping comparison stars in the
      comet fields between nights allowed the relative photometry
      of the other nights to be tied to the reference night
      (night four, 2000-07-31).
 
 
      Data
      ====
      Images are supplied as FITS files with headers produced by
      the IRAF processing, with detached PDS labels generated by
      the Small Bodies Node.
 
      The photometry results are contained in a single, flat ASCII
      table.  The data originally presented in the photometry table
      of Mueller and Samarasinha (2002) [MUELLER&amp;SAMARAS2002] has
      been augmented with UTC date and start time, exposure time,
      airmass and a reference to the specific image file for each
      record.
 
      Note that there are two more lines in this photometry table
      than originally published in Mueller and Samarasinha (2002).
      The published table was truncated to fit the printed page.
      The final two lines have been restored in the electronic
      table.  Also, not every image included in this collection
      has a corresponding line in the photometry table.  When the
      comet was very close to a star, or when the photometric
      errors were too high, the image photometry was not included
      in the summary table.
 
      There are 334 images (comet and Landolt field) in this data
      set, of which 226 comet images are cited in the photometry
      table:

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      Explicit error bars are provided for the derived values of
      the absolute R magnitude.  Standard techniques were used for
      the reduction of the image data and calculation of the
      photometry.
 
      See Mueller and Samarasinha (2002) [MUELLER&amp;SAMARAS2002] for
      details of the image reduction and photometric calibration
      procedures.
 
 
      Review
      ======
      This data set is scheduled for review in October 2003.
