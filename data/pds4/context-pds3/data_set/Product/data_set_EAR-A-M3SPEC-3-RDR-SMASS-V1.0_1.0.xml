  Data Set Overview
  =================
  The Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectrographic Survey (SMASS) was
  initiated in 1990 with the goal of obtaining spectra over the
  visual wavelength region for a substantial number of small (D &lt; 20
  km) main-belt asteroids.  Observations were primarily made using
  the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope, located at the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT
  (MDM) Observatory on the southwest ridge of Kitt Peak in Arizona.
 
  The Mark III spectrograph, equipped with a TI 4849 CCD (398 x 598
  pixels) was used with a low resolution grism (150 line/mm, blazed
  at 7300 A) to cover the wavelength range from 4000 to 10000 A in a
  single exposure, with a dispersion of ~10 A/pixel.  A Wratten 12
  filter (cutoff &lt; 6000 A) was placed over one-half of the CCD dewar
  window (the red spectral half) in order to block the second order
  spectral image.  This technique has the ability to image the entire
  spectrum in a single exposure and has many advantages over piecing
  together the different spectral regions from separate images.  In
  particular, the effects resulting from the asteroid&apos;s rotational
  lightcurve can be neglected when the entire spectral range is
  imaged simultaneously.
 
  While the typical seeing at MDM gives images with a FWHM of less
  than or equal to 2 arcsec, a 4.7 arcsec wide slit, oriented in the
  N-S direction, was regularly used.  This slit width results in a
  spectral resolution of abut 50 A.
 
  A total of 316 asteroids were included in the survey.  The data
  have been published in Xu, et al. (Icarus 115, 1-35, 1995)
  [XUETAL1995].  SMASS is an ongoing survey and data will be added to
  this archive yearly as they are published.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
  The parameters included for each asteroid are scaled reflectance as
  a function of wavelength (in SMASS.TAB), and the first and second
  principal components of the principal component analysis carried
  out on the reflectance spectra (in SMASSPC.TAB).
 
 
  Data
  ====
  The scaled reflectances as a function of wavelength are in the file
  SMASS.TAB.  The data on the 316 different asteroids are
  concatenated in this file.  SMASSNDX.TAB is an index to the data
  table, and gives the starting record, ending record, and number of
  records in SMASS.TAB for each asteroid spectrum.  SMASSPC.TAB gives
  the first and second principal components for each of 315 of the
  asteroids, 5145 Pholus having been omitted from the principal
  component analysis.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
  Principal component analysis was carried out for 315 of the
  asteroid spectra (asteroid 5145 Pholus was omitted from the
  analysis due to its very unusual spectrum).  SMASSPC.TAB gives the
  first and second principal components for each of the 315
  asteroids.  For information on the principal component analysis
  technique, see [CHATFIELDETAL1980].  The eigenvectors for the
  first two principal components are tabulated in SMASSEIG.TAB.
 
  The principal components PC1 and PC2 for each asteroid are
  calculated from the observed reflectances (normalized to unity at
  5500 A), at 50 equally spaced wavelengths from 4800 - 9700 A.  At
  the ith wavelength:
 
  lambda(i) = Wavelength
      E1(i) = ith Eigenvector coefficient for PC1
      E2(i) = ith Eigenvector coefficient for PC2
       R(i) = Asteroid reflectance at lambda(i)
              (normalized to unity at 5500A)
       m(i) = mean value of R(i) for the entire set of asteroid
              spectra
       s(i) = standard deviation of R(i) for the entire set of
              asteroid spectra
 
  PC1 and PC2 are calculated as follows:
 
             50
       PC1 = SUM E1(i)*{[R(i)-m(i)]/s(i)}
             i=1
 
             50
       PC2 = SUM E2(i)*{[R(i)-m(i)]/s(i)}
             i=1
 
   (where &apos;SUM&apos; represents the standard mathematical summation
   notation)
