            specifically: &apos;Passive Payload Checkout 9&apos; (PC9) -
            28-01-2009 and 2-02-2009.

            Payload Checkout 9 (PC9) was the 7th Passive Payload checkout
            conducted during the Rosetta spacecraft&apos;s Cruise Phase. The
            main objective of passive payload checkouts is to verify the
            health of the Rosetta payload through the execution of nominal
            payload &apos;healthcheck&apos; type operation. The Passive
            Payload Checkout 9 executed 28th January and 2nd February 2009.
            The GIADA passive test (GD01 in ESA document) includes standard
            procedures and full functional verification and was executed by
            switching on Main and Redundant I/Fs in sequence and executing
            similar procedures for the two cases. The data reported in this
            data set have been converted from ADC counts to engineering
            values. The quality of the Housekeeping and Calibration data is
            good. Scientific data are due to noise, as no grain event is
            expected during this mission phase. These data must be only
            considered to evaluate GIADA behaviour and not as real scientific
            data. Data reported by GDS and IS are due to noise as no dust
            event is expected during this mission phase. MBS frequency
            changes, once normalised for frequency vs. temperature
            dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants
            existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and Calibration
            data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument
            health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired
            during other mission phases.

        The format of data reported in GIADA data sets is the same
        for all mission phases. Data reported by GDS and IS are due
        to noise as no dust event is expected in this mission phase.
        MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs.
        temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of
        contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping
        and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to
        evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with
        similar data acquired during other mission phases.
