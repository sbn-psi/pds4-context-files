  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This digital image map of Mars is a cartographic extension of a
    previously released set of CDROM volumes containing individual
    Viking Orbiter Images (PDS volumes VO_1001, VO_1002, etc.).
    The data in the latter are pristine, in the sense that they
    were processed only to the extent required to view them as
    images.  They contain the artifacts and the radiometric,
    geometric, and photometric characteristics of the raw data
    transmitted by the spacecraft.  This new volume set, on the
    other hand, contains cartographic compilations made by
    processing the raw images to reduce radiometric and geometric
    distortions and to form geodetically controlled Mosaicked
    Digital Image Models (MDIMs).  (Because the photometric
    processing used in this MDIM was oversimplified, quantitative
    radiometric analysis on this data is not possible.) It also
    contains digitized versions of an airbrushed map of Mars as
    well as a listing of all IAU-approved feature names.  In
    addition, special geodetic and photogrammetric processing has
    been performed to derive rasters of topographic data, or
    Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).  The latter has a format similar
    to that of the MDIM, except that elevation values are used in
    the array instead of image brightness values.  The Mars DTM
    exists in its entirety on Volume 7.  Finally, Volume 7 has a
    listing of SPICE files derived for the Viking images used in
    the MDIM and the DTM.  These files contain updated camera
    orientation matrices for each of the frames.  The matrices are
    by-products of the photogrammetric processing for the control
    network required to compile the MDIM and the DTM.
 
    The CDROM collection serves two purposes.  First, the MDIM and
    DTM collection serves as a data base for interactive map
    browser applications.  Secondly, the CDROM volume set provides
    a dense delivery medium to build higher-derived cartographic
    image and topographic data products such as special map series
    and planning charts for the Mars Observer Project.
 
    This set contains seven volumes with the following contents:
 
    Volume 1
    --------
      Vastitas Borealis Region of Mars (VO_2001): MDIMs in 373
      image files covering the entire north polar region of Mars
      southward from the pole to a latitude of 42.5 deg North.
      Polar Stereographic projection images of the north pole area
      from 80 to 90 degrees are located in the POLAR directory on
      this disk
 
 
    Volume 2
    --------
      Xanthe Terra Region of Mars (VO_2002): MDIMs in 412 image
      files covering the region of Mars from 47.5 deg North
      latitude to 47.5 deg South latitude, and 0 deg longitude to
      90 deg West longitude.
 
 
    Volume 3
    --------
      Amazonis Planitia Region of Mars (VO_2003): MDIMs in 412
      image files covering the region of Mars from 47.5 deg North
      latitude to 47.5 deg South latitude, and 90 deg West
      longitude to 180 deg West longitude.
 
 
    Volume 4
    --------
      Elysium Planitia Region of Mars (VO_2004): MDIMs in 412 image
      files covering the region of Mars from 47.5 deg North
      latitude to 47.5 deg South latitude, and 180 deg West
      longitude to 270 deg West longitude.
 
 
    Volume 5
    --------
      Arabia Terra Region of Mars (VO_2005): MDIMs in 412 image
      files covering the region of Mars from 47.5 deg North
      latitude to 47.5 deg South latitude, and 270 deg West
      longitude to 0 deg West longitude.
 
 
    Volume 6
    --------
      Planum Australe Region of Mars (VO_2006): MDIMs in 373 image
      files covering the entire South polar region of Mars
      northward from the pole to a latitude of 42.5 South latitude.
      Polar Stereographic projection images of the south pole area
      from 80 to 90 degrees are located in the POLAR directory on
      this disk
 
 
    Volume 7
    --------
      Digital Topographic Map of Mars (VO_2007): DTMs of the entire
      planet at 1/64, 1/16, and 1/4 deg/pixel; MDIMs of the entire
      planet at 1/64 and 1/16 deg/pixel; the digitized airbrush map
      of Mars at 1/16 and 1/4 deg/pixel; and revised SPICE files
      for all frames used to compile the MDIM and the DTM.
 
      Each of the first six volumes contains MDIMs of the areas
      specified at resolutions of 1/256 deg/pixel (231m) and at
      1/64 deg/pixel (943m).  Volumes 1, 6, and 7 also contain MDIM
      coverage of the entire planet at 1/16 deg/pixel (3.69 km).
      The seven volumes also include a digitized airbrush map of
      the entire planet at 1/16 deg/pixel (3.69 km) and at 1/4
      deg/pixel.  The Sinusoidal Equal-Area Projection is used for
      all MDIM and DTM files in this collection.  Appendix E of
      this document contains a detailed description of the
      Sinusoidal projection and use of the cartographic keywords
      found in the image labels.
 
      The tiling layout of the 1/64 deg/pixel digital models is the
      same on the first six volumes, but has been modified on
      Volume 7.  The Volume 7 1/64 deg/pixel tile scheme was
      modified so that each tile would contain approximately 1000
      lines and 1000 samples.  The 1/64 and 1/16 deg/pixel MDIM,
      segments of which appear in Volumes 1 through 6, is
      duplicated in its entirety on Volume 7.  All of the
      resolution compressions were done by averaging, not by
      subsampling.  A gazetteer of IAU-approved feature names,
      referenced by latitude/longitude coordinates is included as a
      table file on each of the seven volumes.

    ---------------
      The Planetary Image Cartography System (PICS) is an
      integrated computerized image processing and cartographic
      system for the systematic reduction, display, mapping, and
      analysis of planetary image data.
 
      A design goal in PICS was to develop a single set of generic
      software, simple to use, that would process any of the
      150,000 planetary images from the Voyager, Viking, and
      Mariner Missions.  This required standards to be developed so
      that formats for the image files, calibration files,
      geometric pointing and empherides files for all the missions,
      cameras, and targets be identical.
 
      Normally the PICS software modules are executed on images in
      groups called procedures.  Provided in the PICS software set
      are the procedures that are used in the USGS Planetary
      Cartography effort.  They are referred to as Levels 0 through
      4.  These five procedures are; Level 0 - data preparation,
      read raw planetary image from magnetic tape or CD-ROM to
      create a PICS image file, place geometry and camera
      instrument mode information in the image file labels for
      automatic processing; Level 1 - radiometric correction,
      bit-error suppression, reseaux processing, coherent noise
      suppression, and various cosmetic processes; Level 2 -
      geometric transformation including geometric distortion
      removal and projecting an image to a standard map projection
      and scale; Level 3 - image mosaicking, and Level 4 -
      photometric function processing (both characterizing the
      function as well as removing model functions.)

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
 
    COMPILATION OF DIMs
    -------------------
      Digital image models are compiled and archived in four stages
      or &apos;levels&apos;, beginning with raw images.  All of the
      corrections made during these stages have some level of
      uncertainty, so the processing sequence is designed to
      progress from corrections with the highest probability of
      accuracy to the lowest, and intermediate stages are preserved
      for future analytical use.  Image processing software exists
      to perform the various stages of image correction and
      enhancement [PETTENGILLETAL1980C; SODERBLOM1978].
 
 
    LEVEL 1: RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION
    -------------------------------
      Level 1 processing includes removal of electronic shading,
      which is inherent in the imaging system, and artifacts such
      as minute dust specks on the vidicon tube, microphonic noise
      introduced by operation of other instruments on the
      spacecraft during imaging sequences, and data drop-outs and
      spikes [WU&amp;DOYLE1990].  Reseau marks are also located and
      removed during this stage; their precise locations are
      recorded for use during later geometric processing.  A
      digital image label is created, containing the reseau-mark
      locations, geodetic control point and image tie-point
      locations, and a computed camera orientation matrix that will
      project the frame to a best-fit shape and position in a
      mosaic.
 
      Level 1 images have better resolution than those produced at
      any subsequent processing level.  This is because they have
      not been resampled for geometric correction and projection;
      some loss of information is inevitable in any resampling,
      because the density values of multiple pixels and/or
      fractional pixels must be averaged to form new pixels in the
      output array.  Photographic copies of Level 1 images, with
      spatial filter enhancement, are therefore the more useful
      photographic materials for visual interpretation.  Plans for
      publication and distribution of Level 1 images on CDROM have
      been cancelled, however, because the processing has become so
      efficient that it is less expensive to reprocess images on
      demand than to archive previous processing.  The control
      information and projection matrices contained in Level 1
      image labels are preserved as text files, and can be easily
      recovered if reprocessing is needed.
 
 
    LEVEL 2: GEOMETRIC CORRECTION
    -----------------------------
      Level 2 processing includes removal of camera distortions and
      transformation from image to map coordinates in DM format
      according to parameters derived at the end of the Level 1
      processing phase [BATSON1990A].  The resolution of each frame
      is preserved to some extent by oversampling in the output
      array; that is, by selecting a resolution step that results
      in an image with more lines and samples than the original
      image.  Distortion corrections are based on preflight
      calibration of the reseau.  Image transformation is based on
      camera orientation matrices derived by photogrammetric
      triangulation [25] modified as required for a best fit with
      adjacent images.  On those images where matrices are not
      available, they are derived by matching corresponding points
      with images that have matrices.
 
 
    LEVEL 3: PHOTOMETRIC CORRECTION
    -------------------------------
      At level 3 processing apparent inconsistencies in surface
      brightness caused by variation in illumination geometry and
      by atmospheric effects are treated.  Atmospheric scattering
      is a significant consideration on Mars.  Different materials
      on any planet have different light-reflecting properties.
      Other photometric corrections are effective only to the
      extent that all geometric parameters can be modeled.  In
      general, local topography is not included in the model (i.e.,
      the surface model used is flat).  Illumination geometry at
      each pixel, however, certainly depends on local topography;
      unless the topographic slope within a pixel is accurately
      known and compensated, the photometric correction cannot be
      perfect.  All of these conditions are so complex that
      photometric correction of planetary images is likely to be
      only approximate for some time into the foreseeable future,
      although research into the effects and prototype examples of
      full three-dimensional treatment are now being pursued.  An
      obvious example of the complexity of the problem would
      consist of a pair of images of the same landform illuminated
      from opposite directions.  Only an extremely complex
      algorithm could accurately modify the shading in one of the
      images to match that of the other.  No algorithm could
      restore detail lost in shadow.
 
      The photometric processing used in this MDIM was necessarily
      oversimplified, and incorporates spatial filtration that has
      the effect of subduing regional albedo markings.
 
 
    LEVEL 4: CONTROLLED MOSAICKING
    ------------------------------
      Compilation of an accurate digital mosaic (MDIM) of the
      entire surface of a planet is the final stage in the
      construction of a DIM.  The MDIM is a digital image of the
      planet, with uniform resolution throughout.  The resolution
      of level 2 images used in the compilation is compressed or
      expanded to match that of the MDIM.
