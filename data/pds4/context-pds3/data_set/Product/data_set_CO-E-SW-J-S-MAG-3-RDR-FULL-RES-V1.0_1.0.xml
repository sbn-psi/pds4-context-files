  Data Set Overview
  =================
      This data set contains calibrated full time resolution Cassini
      magnetometer data, for the entire Cassini mission. These data are
      provided in RTN coordinates for cruise, and Kronographic (KRTP)
      coordinates for Saturn Tour. They have been calibrated and converted
      to physical coordinates from the Cassini MAG Raw Data Set
      (CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0), by the Cassini MAG team at
      Imperial College.
 
 
  Parameters

    Data Sampling
    -------------
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    These data have been produced from the Cassini Magnetometer Raw Data
    Set (CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0). They were calibrated, and
    rotated into geophysical coordinates by the Cassini MAG team at
    Imperial College. The time format was changed from International Atomic
    Time (TAI, seconds since epoch 2001-01-01 12:00:00 TAI = 11:59:28 UTC),
    the position data removed, and the data files converted from binary
    (UCLA flatfiles) to ASCII at the PDS PPI Node (UCLA). Information
    regarding the calibration file used to calibrate the data and the SPICE
    kernels used to perform coordinate transformations is included in the
    data product label.

    Bphi      float  magnetic-field phi (eastward) component &lt;nT&gt;
 
    These data were processed using SPICE kernels produced by the
    PDS/NAIF node during the mission. The specific kernels used to
    process each file are indicated in the NOTE included in the
    data product labels.
 
 
  SPICE
  =====
    The data product labels associated with the data set include a list of
    the SPICE kernels that were used in calibrating the associated data, and
    coverting them to physical coordinates. While the SPICE kernels used are
    not part of this data set, these kernels are archived at the PDS-NAIF
    node on the volume cosp_1000. Note that the SPICE kernels listed in each
    of the product labels are may be identified uniquely by their file name.
 
  Coordinate Systems
  ==================
    The data are provided in one of two coordinate systems. RTN
    coordinates for solar wind studies and KRTP coordinates for
    for use in Saturn magnetospheric studies.
 
    Radial-Tangential-Normal Coordinates (RTN)
    ------------------------------------------
      RTN coordinates consist of R (radial component, Sun to the spacecraft),
      T (tangential component, parallel to the Solar Equatorial plane and
      perpendicular to R), and N (normal component, completes right handed
      set).
 
    Kronographic body-fixed, J2000 spherical Coordinates (KRTP)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
      KRTP magnetic field vector components form the standard right
      handed spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a planet centered
      system. Namely, R is radial (along the line from the center of
      Saturn to the center of the spacecraft), and positive away from
      Saturn. Phi, the azimuthal component, is parallel to the
      Kronographic equator (Omega x R) and positive in the direction of
      corotation. Theta, the &apos;southward&apos; component, completes the right
      handed set.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    There are several files that are provided in addition to the data
    files themselves that may be of value to the user. These are provided
    in the /DOCUMENT/DATA_QUALITY directory and are described in the
    DOCINFO.TXT associated with this volume.

  Review
  ======
    These data have been reviewed by the instrument team and are of
    the highest quality that can be generated at this time. Science
    results based on these data have been published in several
    journals (Science, Nature, JGR, etc.). After submission to the
    PDS, these data successfully completed the peer review process.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
 
    Timing Errors
    -------------
 
    Some data files in this data set contain timing errors, including both
    backwards and repeated times. These timing errors are also present in
    the raw data set (CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0) and have not
    been corrected in this data set. However, any timing errors present in
    a data file are noted in the associated PDS label file. A full list of
    all files, and intervals containing timing errors is provided at:
 
    /DOCUMENT/DATA_QUALITY/FGM_FULL_TIMING_ERRS.CSV.
 
    Gaps

   Product Versions
  ================

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
     1       The version 1 data were calibrated at the PDS/PPI node at
             UCLA using software (CAL02), and calibration data provided
             by the Cassini MAG team. The process used the same
             calibration data that was provided with the Raw
             Magnetometer data  archive (Data Set ID:
             CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0). The data were then
             rotated into geophysical coordinates using MAG team
             additonal MAG team provided code (TRANSCAL) and spice
             kernels obtained from NAIF. Reformatting to ASCII was done
             using code developed at PDS/PPI.
 
     2       The version 2 data were calibrated, and rotated into
             geophysical coordinates by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial
             College, and provided to the PDS/PPI node via the MAG team
             Co-I at UCLA. The data were reformatted at PDS/PPI to match
             the format used for the version 1 data.
 
     3       Subsequent to the release of the version 2 data it was
             discovered that the coordinate system trasformation for some
             of the MAG data had been performed using predict SPICE
             kernels, rather than reconstructions. The version 3 were
             reprocessed using reconstructed ephemeris kernels for all of
             the data. The version 3 data were processed following the
             same procedure that was followed for the version 2 data.
 
     4       A few full-res. MAG data files were posted online labeled
             as PRODUCT_VERSION_ID = 4. The data, however, are identical
             with the version 3 data. These data have been relabeled as
             version 3.
