    Stardust Navigation Camera Preflight Calibration Image Data Format:
    ===================================================================
 
 
    Data Set Overview:
    =================
 
        This volume contains the results of the preflight calibration of
    the Stardust Navigation Camera.  The images were collected in an
    attempt to mimic the environment that the camera would experience
    during cruise and encounter with the comet Wild-2.
 
        The images on this calibration volume are in standard PDS format.
    Each file includes an attached PDS label at the beginning of the file,
    followed by a histogram, and ending with the image itself.  The PDS
    label contains two OBJECT definitions, which describe the storage
    requirements for both the histogram and image objects.  The label also
    describes the circumstances surrounding the collection of the
    calibration image.  This meta-data is in keyword and value pairs and
    each of these keywords is described at the end of this document.
 
 
    Camera Description:
    ===================
 
        The camera has a 1024x1024 array as the active portion of the CCD.
    The images that are stored on this volume, however, contain more than
    just the active portion of the CCD.  Each line contains a sync pattern,
    a line counter, 12 baseline stabilization pixels, the 1024 pixels from
    the active portion of the CCD, and finally 8 over-clock pixels used to
    measure the quantum efficiency. The number of rows for each image is
    always 1024, no matter what compression mode is used, but the number of
    columns for each image depends on the compression mode used.
 
 
    Compression Modes:
    ==================
 
        The navcam images can be either 8-bit or 12-bit data.  The 12-bit
    data is commonly referred to as &apos;uncompressed data&apos;, while the 8-bit is
    referred to as &apos;compressed data&apos;.  This compression is accomplished by a
    12-bit to 8-bit square-root look-up-table compression method, which is
    implemented in the hardware of the camera electronics.  This compression
    is lossy and the estimate of the 12-bit image can be recovered using the
    look-up table mentioned in Appendix 3 of the Calibration Document.  Both
    the image and histogram portions of the data file require different
    amounts of storage space, dependent on the compression mode used.
 
 
    Pixel storage requirements:
    ===========================
 
        In uncompressed mode with 12-bit data, the pixels are expressed in
    two bytes, as 16 bits per pixel.  The upper nibble of the most
    significant byte is always zero for these images.  In compressed mode
    with 8-bit data, the pixels are expressed in a single byte.
 
 
    Number of Columns within each Row:
    ==================================
 
        The general form of each line for each image is fixed.  The row of
    data from the camera can be categorized into five different regions:
 
        1. Sync Pattern           Always 2 bytes, with value   0x0000
        2. Line Counter           Always 2 bytes, values from 0 to 1023
        3. 8 BLS pixels          *Baseline Stabilization pixels, either 1 or
                                     2 bytes per pixel
        4. 1024 image pixels     *Either 1 or 2 bytes per pixel
        5. 12 over-clock pixels  *Used to measure quantum efficiency, either
                                     1 or 2 bytes per pixel
 
    * The pixels are either 1 or 2 bytes per pixel dependent on the
      compression mode.  Uncompressed, 12-bit images require 2 bytes per
      pixel, while compressed 8-bit images require 1 byte per pixel.
 
    For the uncompressed, 12-bit data, each row contains 1046 &apos;pixels&apos; of
    data, which is exactly 2092 bytes.  This is 2 bytes for the sync, 2
    bytes for the line counter, 8 pixels at 2 bytes per pixel, 1024 pixels
    at 2 bytes per pixel and, finally, 12 pixels at 2 bytes per pixel.  In
    equation form:
 
        bytes_per_uncompressed_line = 2 + 2 + 2 * ( 8 + 1024 + 12 ) = 2092
 
    For the compressed, 8-bit data, each row contains 1048 &apos;pixels&apos; of data,
    which is exactly 1048 bytes.  This is 2 bytes for the sync, 2 bytes for
    the line counter, 8 pixels at 1 byte per pixel, 1024 pixels at 1 bytes
    per pixel and, finally, 12 pixels at 1 bytes per pixel.  In equation
    form:
 
        bytes_per_compressed_line = 2 + 2 + 1 * ( 8 + 1024 + 12 ) = 1048
 
 
    Reading with RAW image readers:
    =================================
 
        When using any of the supported PDS readers, this extra data at the
    beginning and end of the line is not displayed, but when reading these
    images with a raw raster-scan style reader, this extra data at the
    beginning and ending of each line must be taken into account.
 
 
    Values to use when reading images with a RAW readers:
    =====================================================
 
    Compression Mode    # Rows  # Columns   Data Type
    -----------------   ------  ---------   ------------------------------
      Compressed         1024    1048        BYTE data
      Uncompressed       1024    1046        MSB_Unsigned_integer (16-bit)
 
 
    Finding the offset to the data within the file:
    ===============================================
 
        When trying to read the histogram or image arrays from the file
    using a RAW reader, the reader must first skip all of the information
    before the object to be read.  As an example, to read the image object
    using a raw reader, the reader must first skip the PDS attached header,
    as well as the histrogram data.  To determine the amount of data to
    skip, examine two keyword pairs from the attached label.
 
    To advance to the beginning of the histogram data, examine the following
    keywords:
            RECORD_BYTES         = 2092
            ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM     = 3
    The first keyword defines the number of bytes within each record, while
    the second keyword indicates at which record the data begins.  In this
    example, the data starts in record #3.  This indicates that 2 other
    records contain data prior to the start of the histogram data.  To
    compute the data offset, account for 2 records of data:  in this
    example, the offset is (3-1)*2092 = 4184.
 
    To advance to the beginning of the image data, examine the following
    keywords:
            RECORD_BYTES         = 2092
            ^IMAGE               = 11
    As in the previous example, the first keyword defines the number of
    bytes within each record.  The second keyword indicates the record at
    which the image data begins.  To compute the data offset, follow the
    example above:
            Offset = ( ^image_histogram - 1 ) * record_bytes.
        Ex: Offset = ( 11 - 1) * 2092 = 20920

    Definition of Keywords/Values from the PDS Data Dictionary:
    ===========================================================
 
       PDS_VERSION_ID             The pds_version_id keyword indicates the
                                  version number of the PDS standards
                                  documents that is valid when a data
                                  product label is created.  Values for
                                  the PDS_VERSION_ID are formed by
                                  appending the integer for the latest
                                  version number to the letters &apos;PDS&apos;.
                                  Examples: PDS3, PDS4.
 
       RECORD_TYPE                The record_type keyword indicates the
                                  record format of a file.  Note:  In
                                  the PDS, when record_type is used in a
                                  detached label file it always
                                  describes its corresponding detached
                                  data file, not the label file itself.
                                  The use of record_type along with
                                  other file-related data elements is
                                  fully described in the PDS Standards
                                  Reference.
 
       RECORD_BYTES               The record_bytes keyword indicates the
                                  number of bytes in a physical file
                                  record, including record terminators
                                  and separators.
 
       FILE_RECORDS               The file_records keyword indicates the
                                  number of physical file records,
                                  including both label records and data
                                  records.
 
       ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM           The image_histogram object represents
                                  a pointer to the image histogram.  The
                                  value is in RECORD_BYTE units and
                                  indicates that the data starts at the
                                  beginning of the record mentioned.  As
                                  an example, if the pointer value is 4,
                                  then the 3 records are populated with
                                  other data.  If the bytes per record
                                  is 2092, the image histogram data
                                  starts at byte 6276
 
       ^IMAGE                     The ^image pointer represents a byte
                                  offset to the image data.  The value
                                  is in RECORD_BYTE units.  As an
                                  example, if the pointer value is 11,
                                  and the bytes per record is 2092, the
                                  image histogram data starts at byte
                                  20920.
 
       MISSION_NAME               The mission_name element identifies a
                                  major planetary mission or project.  A
                                  given planetary mission may be
                                  associated with one or more

       OBJECT = IMAGE_HISTOGRAM   The histogram object is a sequence of
                                  numeric values that provides the
                                  number of occurrences of a data value
                                  or a range of data values in a data
                                  object.  The number of items in a
                                  histogram will normally be equal to
                                  the number of distinct values allowed
                                  in a field of the data object.  (For
                                  example, an 8-bit integer field can
                                  have 256 values.  This would result in
                                  a 256-item histogram.)  Histograms may
                                  be used to bin data, in which case an
                                  offset and scaling factor indicate the
                                  dynamic range of the data represented.
                                  The following equation allows the
                                  calculation of the range of each &apos;bin&apos;
                                  in the histogram.  &apos;bin lower
                                  boundary&apos; = (&apos;bin element&apos; *
                                  scaling_factor) + offset.
 
       ITEMS                      The items element defines the number
                                  of multiple, identical occurrences of
                                  an single object, such as a column.
                                  See also: repetitions.  Note:  In the
                                  PDS, the data element ITEMS is used
                                  for multiple occurrences of a single
                                  object, such as a column.  REPETITIONS
                                  is used for multiple occurrences of a
                                  repeating group of objects, such as a
                                  container.  For a fuller description
                                  of the use of these data elements,
                                  please refer to the Standards
                                  Reference.
 
       DATA_TYPE                  The data_type element supplies the
                                  internal representation and/or
                                  mathematical properties of a value
                                  being stored.  See also:
                                  bit_data_type, general_data_type.
                                  Note: In the PDS, users may find a
                                  bit-level description of each data

       ITEM_BITS                  The item_bits element indicates the
                                  number of bits allocated for a
                                  particular bit data item.  Note: In
                                  the PDS, the item_bits element is used
                                  when the items element specifies
                                  multiple occurrences of an implied
                                  item within a BIT_COLUMN object
                                  definition.
 
       END_OBJECT                 The end_object element terminates the
                                  object description.
 
       OBJECT = IMAGE             A regular array of sample values.
                                  Image objects are normally processed
                                  with special display tools to produce
                                  a visual representation of the sample
                                  values.  This is done by assigning
                                  brightness levels or display colors to
                                  the various sample values.  Images are
                                  composed of LINES and SAMPLES.  They
                                  may contain multiple bands, in one of
                                  several storage orders.
 
                                  Note: Additional engineering values
                                  may be prepended or appended to each
                                  LINE of an image, and are stored as
                                  concatenated TABLE objects, which must
                                  be named LINE_PREFIX and LINE_SUFFIX.
                                  IMAGE objects may be associated with
                                  other objects, including HISTOGRAMs,
                                  PALETTEs, HISTORY, and TABLEs which
                                  contain statistics, display
                                  parameters, engineering values, or
                                  other ancillary data.
 
 
       LINES                      The lines element indicates the total
                                  number of data instances along the
                                  vertical axis of an image.  Note:  In
                                  PDS label convention, the number of
                                  lines is stored in a 32-bit integer
                                  field.  The minimum value of 0
                                  indicates no data received.
 
       LINE_SAMPLES               The line_samples element indicates the
                                  total number of data instances along
                                  the horizontal axis of an image.
 
       SAMPLE_TYPE                The sample_type element indicates the
                                  data storage representation of sample
                                  value.
 
       SAMPLE_BITS                The sample_bits element indicates the
                                  stored number of bits, or units of
                                  binary information, contained in a
                                  line_sample value.
 
       SAMPLE_BIT_MASK            The sample_bit_mask element identifies
                                  the active bits in a sample.  Note:
                                  In the PDS, the domain of
                                  sample_bit_mask is dependent upon the
                                  currently-described value in the
                                  sample_bits element and only applies
                                  to integer values.  For an 8-bit
                                  sample where all bits are active the
                                  sample_bit_mask would be 2#11111111#.
 
       MAXIMUM                    The maximum element indicates the
                                  largest value occurring in a given
                                  instance of the data object.
 
       MINIMUM                    The minimum element indicates the
                                  smallest value occurring in a given
                                  instance of the data object.
 
       LINE_PREFIX_BYTES          The line_prefix_bytes element
                                  indicates the number of non-image
                                  bytes at the beginning of each line.
                                  The value must represent an integral
                                  number of bytes.
 
       LINE_SUFFIX_BYTES          The line_suffix_bytes element
                                  indicates the number of non-image
                                  bytes at the end of each line.  This
                                  value must be an integral number of
                                  bytes.
 
       MEAN                       The mean element provides the average
                                  of the DN values in the image array.
 
       STANDARD_DEVIATION         The standard_deviation element
                                  provides the standard deviation of the
                                  DN values in the image array.
 
       SATURATED_PIXELS           The saturated_pixels element provides
                                  a count of the number of pixels in the
                                  array which at the maximum DN value.
                                  For this dataset, the non-quantized
                                  data has a maximum value of 4095,
                                  while the quantized data has a maximum
                                  value of 255.
 
       CHECKSUM                   The checksum element represents an
                                  unsigned 32-bit sum of all data values
                                  in a data object.

    The data collected here has been prepared with the highest concern
    for the perfectness of the data delivered.  During the processing of
    the image data in preparation for delivery with this volume, the
    structure of each image was verified.  This verification included
    detection of both the sync word and the line count bytes at the
    beginning of each line.
