            Volume containing data from &apos;Earth swing-by 3&apos; and more

            Payload Checkout 10 (PC10) was an active checkout where a target
            independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
            request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload
            teams. All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario The Active
            Payload Checkout 10 ran for 12 consecutive days starting on the
            21th September 2009 until the 2th October 2009. This is the
            allocated time of the active PC10 scenario that preceded it PC10
            consists of two phases. The 1st phase is a passive test (GD01)
            similar to the previous Passive Payload Checkouts the 2nd phase
            is an active test; GD02 is dealt with GIADA/VIRTIS interference
            test, in GD03 we upload on-board of new Context File settings
            performing and checking new procedures, GD_INT is dealt with
            GIADA/ROSINA interference test. The passive test (GD01), which
            includes standard procedures and full functional verification,
            was executed by switching on Main and Redundant I/Fs in sequence
            and executing similar procedures for the two cases. GD02, GD03
            and GD_INT were executed only on Main I/F. The data reported in
            this data set have been converted from ADC counts to engineering
            values. The quality of the Housekeeping and Calibration data is
            good. Scientific data are due to noise, as no grain event is
            expected during this mission phase. These data must be only
            considered to evaluate GIADA behaviour and not as real scientific
            data. Data reported by GDS and IS are due to noise as no dust
            event is expected during this mission phase. MBS frequency
            changes, once normalised for frequency vs. temperature
            dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants
            existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and Calibration
            data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument
            health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired
            during other mission phases.

        The format of data reported in GIADA data sets is the same
        for all mission phases. Data reported by GDS and IS are due
        to noise as no dust event is expected in this mission phase.
        MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs.
        temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of
        contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping
        and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to
        evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with
        similar data acquired during other mission phases.
