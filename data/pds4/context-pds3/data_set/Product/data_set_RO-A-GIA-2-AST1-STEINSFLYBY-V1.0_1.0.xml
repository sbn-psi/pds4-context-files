            Volume containing data from &apos;Steins Fly By&apos; and more
            specifically: &apos;GIADA STEINS FLY BY&apos; (STEINS) held on

            The report provides the results from GIADA experiment during
            theRosetta Steins Flyby. Asteroid Steins was the first dedicated
            scientific target of the Rosetta mission. Unfortunately the three
            subsystem of GIADA were not able to study Steins, so GIADA during
            asteroid flyby was in a non-nominal operational configuration,
            i.e.only the impact sensor operational and the cover closed.
            Therefore, during Steins fly-by we have only checked the status
            of GIADA instrument. Scientific operations targeting the asteroid
            started on 1 Sept. 2008 and ended on 10 Sept. 2008 and the
            Closest approach was on 5 Sept. 2008 at 18:38:20 UTC. Actually
            GIADA was in operation only the 5th Sept. 2008 just for 15
            minutes. It also contains documentation which describes the GIADA
            experiment. The data reported in this data set have been
            converted from ADC counts to engineering values. The quality of
            the Housekeeping and Calibration data is good. Scientific data
            are due to noise, as no grain event is expected during this
            mission phase. These data must be only considered to evaluate
            GIADA behaviour and not as real scientific data. Data reported by
            GDS and IS are due to noise as no dust event is expected during
            this mission phase. MBS frequency changes, once normalised for
            frequency vs. temperature dependence, if present, are due to
            deposition of contaminants existing in the S/C environment.
            Housekeeping and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are
            useful to evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared
            with similar data acquired during other mission phases.

        The format of data reported in GIADA data sets is the same
        for all mission phases. Data reported by GDS and IS are due
        to noise as no dust event is expected in this mission phase.
        MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs.
        temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of
        contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping
        and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to
        evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with
        similar data acquired during other mission phases.
