            This data set includes J, H, and Ks magnitudes from the Two
            Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) for sources which were positionally
            associated with asteroids, comets, planets, and planetary
            satellites. This version includes the 2MASS Extended Mission.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) carried out a survey of the entire
    sky at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and Ks (2.17 microns) during
    the years 1997-2001. The survey was conducted by two nearly identical
    telescopes and instruments, one at the Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins,
    in Arizona, and one at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory on Cerro
    Tololo in Chile.  A single data processing pipeline was used for the
    entire survey.  The All-Sky Point Source Catalog (PSC), released in March
    2003, contains photometry and astrometry for 470,999,970 sources, of which
    16,028 were positionally associated with known solar system bodies
    including asteroids, comets, planets, and planetary satellites.  The JHKs
    photometry for these sources, with their associations, were released as
    the original 2MASS Asteroid and Comet Survey, V1.0 of this data set.
 
    The 2MASS Extended Mission extended the survey by the inclusion of
    additional source extractions which were not selected for the original PSC
    because they were either a) unused duplicate detections of sources in the
    overlapping regions between tiles, b) too faint to meet the catalog
    standards for completeness and reliability, or c) identified as detections
    of image artifacts with a probability that would compromise catalog
    reliability.  The overall reliability of these additional source
    extractions is much lower than that of the All-Sky Release, and they are
    not a uniform representation of the near infrared sky.
 
    The Extended Mission also added two new databases of detections, the Long
    Exposure (6x) Extracted Source Database, and the Calibration Extracted
    Source Database.  The 6x database contains extracted sources from scans
    taken at six times the normal Survey exposure time to probe ~1 magnitude
    deeper than the nominal Survey.  These observations cover approximately
    590 square degrees on selected astronomical targets.  The Calibration
    database contains sources extracted from the scans of the 35 primary
    calibration fields which
    were used to derive the nightly photometric calibration transformations.
 
    Version 2.0 of this data set contains all the sources in the original
    release plus additional source extractions from the Survey, from the 6x
    extracted source database, and from the Calibration extracted source
    database.
 
    Orbital elements used to predict the positions of the asteroids, comets,
    planets, and satellites is given in the data files in the form of p and q
    position vectors.
 
    Plots of the filter profiles of the J, H, and Ks filters are included in
    the document directory.
 
    Detection of unknown solar system bodies in the 2MASS data is technically
    possible, but has not been carried out for this data set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Association between predicted solar system objects and 2MASS source
    positions does not imply a physical identification.  An estimate of the
    reliability of the 2MASS source extraction for a given source may be found
    in the RELIABILITY_FLAG given in the data tables.
 
    Sources derived from the 2MASS Extended Mission Ancillary Products have
    not received the same level of validation and scrutiny as the All-Sky
    Release sources.  The data base from which each individual source in the
    data tables has been derived can be determined from the DS_ORIGIN flag
    given in the tables.
 
    Because the association of asteroid positions and 2MASS sources is blind,
    there is always the chance of association with background astrophysical
    sources, particularly at low galactic latitudes.  Stars near the galactic
    plane will tend to be reddened by foreground dust, giving rise to a
    redward spike in the (J-H) (H-Ks) color-color plot.  Contamination from
    galactic stars in the 2MASS asteroid associations is shown by such a
    redward spike in the color-color plot of the asteroid associations. For
    further discussion of the contamination problem, see [SYKESETAL2002]:

    Proceedings of Asteroids, Comets, Meteors (ACM 2002), Technical University
    Berlin, Berlin, Germany, pp. 484-484, 2002.
 
    The confidence level of the positional association of sources with solar
    system bodies and of the photometric and astrometric measurements is
    indicated by flags within the data tables.  These flags are defined in the
    file flagdef.txt in the document directory of the data set.
