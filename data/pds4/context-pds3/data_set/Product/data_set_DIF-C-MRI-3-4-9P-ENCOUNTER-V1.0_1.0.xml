  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains reduced images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 acquired by
    the Deep Impact Medium Resolution Instrument Visible CCD (MRI) during
    the encounter phase of the mission.
 
    The 9P/Tempel 1 data are described in &apos;Deep Impact:  The Anticipated
    Flight Data&apos; by Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENTAL2005].  For more
    details about the images taken around impact, refer to the MRI
    encounter data summary document which provides a log of the exposures
    taken from 28 hours before impact through lookback.

  Processing
  ==========
    The reduced, two-dimensional FITS images in this data set were
    generated by the Deep Impact calibration pipeline, maintained by the
    project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  The
    pipeline performed the following reduction steps to produce the
    images in this data set:
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS headers
      - Decompression of compressed images
      - Correction for uneven bit weighting due to analog-to-digital
        (ADC) conversion (a unit correction)
      - Subtraction of a dark frame
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk removal
      - Application of a flat field
      - Normalization of quadrant gains
      - Removal of CCD transfer smear
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration
 
    The resulting data were provided in physical units of radiance,
    Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron).  These data, designated by the
    pneumonic &apos;&apos;RADREV&apos;&apos;, were not cleaned and are considered reversible
    because the calibration steps can be removed to get back to the
    original, raw data numbers.
 
    During the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension, so the
    following types of pixels could be identified:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information
      - Pixels considered bad as indicated by bad pixel maps
 
    The pipeline also created a FITS image extension for a signal-to-noise
    ratio map.  The calibration steps and files used to reduce each raw
    image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS
    data label for that image.  For a detailed discussion of the
    calibration pipeline and the resulting data, see the instrument
    calibration document by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    CCD Images
    ----------
      The two-dimensional, CCD images in this data set are in FITS format.
      The primary data array contains the image, followed by two image
      extensions that are pixel-by-pixel maps which provide additional
      information about the primary image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data label defines the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each image FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS label.  For
      more information about the FITS primary image and extensions, refer
      to the instrument calibration document.
 
 
    Compression
    -----------
      The calibration pipeline used one of four lossy lookup tables to
      decompress raw images that were compressed onboard the spacecraft.
      For information about data compression, see the Deep Impact
      instruments document by Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] or
      the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006)
      [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;&apos;As Seen By Observer&apos;&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the data labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = &apos;RIGHT&apos;
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = &apos;UP&apos;
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
      Using this convention for Tempel 1 approach images, ecliptic East is
      toward the top, ecliptic North is toward the right, and the Sun is
      down.  After impact, the Flyby spacecraft came out of shield mode
      and turned around to lookback at the comet.  For lookback images,
      ecliptic East is toward the top, ecliptic North is toward the left,
      and the Sun is down.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation of MRI flight images with those
      from ground-based calibrations as well as those from the High
      Resolution Instrument CCD (HRIV) and the Impactor Targeting Sensor
      CCD (ITS), see the quadrant nomenclature section of the &apos;Deep Impact
      Instrument Calibration&apos; document.
 
      It is important to note that, in published results about the
      encounter, the project elected to rotate MRI images such that
      ecliptic East is to the left, ecliptic North is up, and the Sun is
      to the right for approach images.  This is equivalent to rotating an
      image counter-clockwise by 90 degrees with respect to the convention
      provided above.  Published lookback images were rotated clockwise by
      90 degrees with with respect to the convention provided above such
      that ecliptic East to the right, ecliptic North up, and the Sun to
      the left.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the image labels and FITS files is
      MVcccccccccc_iiiiiii_nnn_RR.LBL or FIT where cccccccccc is the
      spacecraft clock count at the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee
      is the exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels).  Up to 999
      individual images could be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      image number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER
      in the data labels.  For example, if two images were commanded for
      exposure ID 9009001, the two FITS files names would be
      MVcccccccccc_9009001_001_RR.FIT and MVcccccccccc_9009001_002_RR.FIT.
      Finally, RR identifies the reduction level, RADREV:  reversible data
      in units of radiance (RADREV).  This reduction level is described in
      the instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Reduced RADREV data are in units of radiance, W/(m**2 steradian
      micron).  The data are reversible and are not cleaned.
 
 
    Imaging Modes and Filters
    ------------------------
      For descriptions of the imaging modes and filters, please see the
      Deep Impact instrument paper by Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005].
 
      Most image modes had a set of bias overclock rows and columns,
      located around the edges of the image array.  All overclock pixels
      were excluded from the calculation of the values for MINIMUM,
      MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      The TIME_FROM_IMPACT_VALUE keyword in the data labels was based on
      the estimated impact time at the flyby spacecraft of UTC
      05:44:35.821 on 4 Jul 2005, as published by A&apos;Hearn, et al. (2005)
      [AHEARNETAL2005A].
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SDC attempted to calculate geometric parameters relating to the
      target only when it was within several fields of view of the
      instrument boresight.  When these parameters could not be
      calculated, the corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were
      set to a value of unknown (UNK).
 
      Geometric parameters were computed using the best SPICE kernels
      available at the time of calibration and the results were stored in
      the FITS header.  For impact images, geometric parameters such as
      the target-to-spacecraft distance were computed with respect to the
      impact site, not the center of the comet.
 
      Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
      the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
      and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
      calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
      earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
      left the target.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  The Deep Impact
      project generated self-consistent SPICE kernels, outside of NAIF, to
      help account for the discrepancy.  The November 2005 version of
      these kernels was used to calculate the image times and geometric
      information in PDS data labels.  After further analysis of the
      timing problem in early 2006, improved self-consistent SPICE kernels
      were generated by the Deep Impact project.  The improved kernels
      were included in the DI SPICE data set.  For more information about
      this discrepancy, please see the spacecraft clock correlation
      document included on the Deep Impact document volume.
 
      The SPICE kernels used to calculated the geometric parameters are
      provided by the SPICE_FILE_NAME keyword in the PDS data labels. The
      kernels are listed in the order they were loaded into memory for
      processing.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the November 2005 version of the SPICE data.  These were the best
    available data at the time of image creation.  Since image creation,
    some SPICE kernels were improved, and these were archived in the Deep
    Impact SPICE data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep
    Impact document volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used extensively by the science team.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set passed a PDS peer review that took place on April 5,
    2006.  Reviewers stated these data should be archived pending
    resolution of the liens produced during the review.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  ========================
    There are no gaps in this data set.  All raw, Tempel 1 images were
    successfully reduced and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.
    For more information, refer to the notes about image quality map in
    the PDS data label or to the instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software overwrote the first 50 uncompressed (or 100
      compressed) pixels of first quadrant read out from the instrument
      with an image header.  These header pixels were included in the
      reduced FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary
      dramatically, it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and
      MAXIMUM keywords in the PDS data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL
      in the FITS header) be used to scale an image for display because
      these values exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows
      and columns located around the edge of the image.  The location of
      the header bytes in a FITS image depends on the readout order of the
      instrument, as discussed in the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      instrument calibration document.
