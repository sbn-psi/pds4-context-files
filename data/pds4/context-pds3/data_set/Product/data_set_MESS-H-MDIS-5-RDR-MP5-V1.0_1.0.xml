            Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists
            of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle
            Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset
            includes 5-Color Multispectral Reduced Data Records for the WAC.
            The 5-Color Map Projected Multispectral RDR (MP5) data set
            consists of a 5-color map of northern latitudes acquired during
            MESSENGER&apos;s Extended Mission, and includes I/F in the 5
            filters used for this map. This product has higher spatial
            resolution than, and complements, an 8-color multispectral map
            acquired during the primary mission (in MDR data products). It
            has better spectral sampling and the same spatial resolution, and
            complements, a 3-color multispectral map also acquired during the
            Extended Mission (in MD3 data products). It is intended to search
            for spatial variations in color properties of the northern
            volcanic plains. This product is photometrically normalized to a
            solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0
            degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling
            of 128 pixels per degree. The map consists of a single tile
            covering the north polar quadrangle or &apos;Mercury chart&apos;
            already defined by the USGS (H01), plus the northern parts of the
            4 Mercury charts immediately to the south (H02-H05). The tile is
            composed of 5 bands corresponding to 5 of the 11 WAC filters. The
            tile also contains 6 backplanes describing ancillary information.
            The subset of 5 of 11 available multispectral filters samples
            albedo and spectral slope over MDIS&apos;s wavelength range.
            Unlike the 3- and 8-color products, which were acquired with the
            WAC pointed near nadir, the 5-color map was acquired pointed at a
            nearly uniform phase angle near 30 degrees to minimize shadowing
            at the high latitudes of the Northern Volcanic Plains.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      MDIS 5-color imaging of Mercury is mosaicked into a single
      128 pixel/degree tile (MP5). This tile corresponds to the pre-existing
      Mercury chart H01, plus the northern part of the chart to the
      immediate south, H02-H05.
 
      Map tiles are named based on the quadrant of the Mercury chart they
      span:
 
      MDIS_ppp_rrrPPD_Hxxddv.IMG
 
      where:
 
        ppp = product type = MP5
        rrr = resolution in pixels/degree (PPD)
        Hxx = Mercury chart designation
        dd = quadrant within Mercury chart (NW, NE, SW, or SE), or a
           polar chart (NP, SP)
        v = version number
 
      The following is an example file name with a description of the
      individual components:
 
      MDIS_MP5_128PPD_H01NP0.IMG
 
      For this image:
        Product type = MP5 (MP5)
        Resolution = 128 pixels/degree (128PPD)
        Mercury chart = Borealis (H01)
        Quadrant = North Polar (NP)
        Version = 0
 
      The MP5 directory, present in the MP5 archive volume, contains
      the 5-Color MDIS Map Projected Multispectral Reduced Data Record
      (MP5). MP5 files are located in a subdirectory based on
      Mercury Chart.  Latitude and longitude limits of Mercury Charts
      overlapped by the MD5, as named at the end of mission, are:
 
      Quadrangle         Subdirectory   Lat. (degrees)  Long. (deg. east)
      H-1 Borealis       H01            65 to 90        0 to 360
      H-2 Victoria       H02            22.5 to 65      270 to 360
      H-3 Shakespeare    H03            22.5 to 65      180 to 270
      H-4 Raditladi      H04            22.5 to 65      90 to 180
      H-5 Hokusai        H05            22.5 to 65      0 to 90
 
      The center latitude and center longitude of the MP5 is located
      in H01 so only that directory is populated.
 
      An MP5:
      - Consists of map-projected photometrically normalized I/F CDRs
        mosaicked into a multispectral map tile;
      - Contains image data in I/F corrected photometrically to i=30
        degrees, e=0 at a resolution of 128 pixels per degree (~332 m/pixel
        at the equator);
      - Is composed of 5 bands corresponding to the 5 of the 11
        WAC filters; and
      - Contains 6 backplanes:
        (a) image count, the number of image sets averaged at a given
        latitude/longitude coordinate, and (b-f) standard deviations
        of the values used to determine average normalized
        I/F in each of the 5 bands.
 
    Versions
    ========
 
      Version numbers of the MP5 increment on reprocessing or addition of
      new data. The map tile is in polar stereographic projection.
 
      Version 1 is released at PDS release 15. It is controlled and projected
      onto a global digital elevation model. It uses a Kasseleinin-Shkuratov
      photometric model, whose parameters are the same for any given
      wavelength band across all MESSENGER end-of-mission map data
      products. I/F is taken from version 5 CDRs.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      MDIS observing variables pertaining to the MP5 are as follows.
 
      Pixel Binning: Some images are unbinned and 1024x1024 pixels.
      Some images are 2x2 pixel binned in the focal plane hardware
      (also known as &apos;on-chip&apos; binning), resulting in 512 x 512
      images. Images can be further compressed 2x2 using the MP,
      in addition to DPU binning, yielding 256x256 images. Images
      used in 5-color MP5 products are mostly not binned although some
      taken at the lowest altitudes are binned 2x2 &apos;on-chip&apos;. This
      less aggressive binning strategy than in the Primary Mission
      8-color products results in nearly a &gt;2x reduction in the
      native pixel scale of the data.
 
      12-8 bit compression: Images are read off the detector in 12-bit
      format. 12 bit images may converted to 8 bit images using one of
      eight lookup tables (LUTs). All WAC images collected as part of
      the 5-color multispectral map have been converted to 8 bits.
 
      FAST/DPCM compression: All images are compressed losslessly using
      FAST/DCPM compression as they are read out of the DPU, to conserve
      recorder space. Once the data are written to the recorder, they can
      be uncompressed and recompressed more aggressively in the MP.
 
      Wavelet compression: Images may be integer wavelet transform-
      compressed in the MP, typically at 3:1 for color data. Color
      imaging was taken losslessly compressed when downlink volume
      permitted it.
 
      Exposure Control: The exposure time of MDIS images can be set
      manually by command, or automatically by the software. In manual
      mode, exposure times from 1-989, 1001-1989, ..., to 9001-9989 ms
      are available. In autoexposure mode the exposure time of the next
      image is computed by the DPU software, and cannot exceed 989 ms
      in duration. If the time of the next image occurs before the
      calculation can be completed, and pixel binning or filter
      position change, then the algorithm compensates for predicted
      changes in scene brightness and filter transmission using an
      onboard data structure. All images in the MP5 were acquired using
      automatic exposure.
 
      Pointing: The MDIS imagers are mounted on a pivot platform, which
      is itself mounted to the MESSENGER spacecraft deck. The pivot
      platform is controlled by a stepper motor, which is controlled by
      the Data Processing Unit (DPU). The pivot platform can move in
      either direction. The total range of motion is 240 degrees, limited
      by mechanical &apos;hard&apos; stops, and is further constrained by &apos;soft&apos;
      stops applied by the software. The nominal pointing position for
      MDIS is defined as 0 degrees, aligned with the spacecraft +Z axis
      and the boresight for several other instruments. The range of the
      soft stops is set to 40 degrees in the spacecraft -Y direction
      (toward the MESSENGER sunshade) and +50 degrees in the +Y direction
      (away from the sunshade). The pivot position can be commanded in
      intervals of 0.01 degrees within this range. During acquisition of
      the 5-color multispectral map, the pivot was used to point the WAC
      to near-constant low phase angles near 30 degrees, allowing
      emission angle to vary.
 
      Filter selection: The WAC imager contains a 12 position filter
      wheel to provide spectral imaging over the spectral range of the
      CCD detector. Five of the filters were chosen for the map and
      appear in the MP5 in order of increasing wavelength:
        WAC filter 6 (filter F), 430 BP 40
        WAC filter 4 (filter D), 560 BP 5
        WAC filter 7 (filter G), 750 BP 5
        WAC filter 12 (filter L), 830 BP 5
        WAC filter 9 (filter I), 1000 BP 15
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      A sequence of processing creates an MP5 from CDRs and DDRs. A Derived
      Data Record (DDR) consists of multiband images whose line and sample
      dimensions and coordinates correspond one-for-one with those of a
      CDR. It has 5 bands of data used to help create an MP5, including for
      every image pixel: (a) latitude, (b) longitude, (c) incidence angle,
      (d) emission angle, and (e) phase angle. The DDRs are an intermediate
      product used to create MP5s and other map products, are defined as a
      distinct data product in the MDIS CDR/RDR Software Interface
      Specification, and are delivered to the PDS.
 
      The sequence of processing is as follows:
 
    (a) Experiment Data Records (EDRs) are assembled from raw data.
    (b) Radiance images are created from the EDRs and calibration files.
    (c) Radiance is converted to I/F CDRs by dividing by (pi * solar flux
        at 1 AU / heliocentricdistance_in_AU^2).
    (d) I/F is photometrically corrected to i = 30 degrees, e = 0 degrees.
    (e) Pivot positions are extracted from the spacecraft housekeeping
        and formatted as a pivot C kernel.
    (f) Using the pivot C kernel and other SPICE kernels, DDRs are
        created. The surface intercept on a model of Mercury&apos;s surface
        is calculated for each spatial pixel. The angles of this pixel
        relative to the equatorial plane and reference longitude constitute
        the latitude and longitude of the pixel. For that latitude and
        longitude, solar incidence, emission, and phase angles are
        determined.
    (g) I/F corrected to i = 30 degrees, e = 0 degrees is map projected
        into multiband MP5s using the latitude and longitude information
        in the DDRs. Backplanes are populated using statistics on the
        count and standard deviations of images that are averaged to
        populate each of the bands of normalized I/F.
 
      For the version 1 MP5, at any location, all images that fall within the
      following criteria are averaged, to reduce residuals from the time-
      variable instrument calibration. This results in a spatially variable
      number of images having been averaged:
 
      - Controlled images are only used, with the G filter images
        part of the control set, and other filters in any given
        color set registered to the G filter images
      - Only uses images from the 3-color mapping campaign
      - For tiles north of 75N latitude:
        - Incidence angle at the center of the images is &lt; 86.5 degrees
        - Image ID &gt; 4000000 to avoid some high-incidence early data
      - For tiles south of 75N latitude:
        - Incidence angle at the center of the images is &lt; 83 degrees
        - Image ID &gt; 4460000 to avoid some high-incidence early data
 
      For the MP5 delivered at the end of the mission, the form of the
      photometric correction used is a Kasseleinen-Shkuratov function
      described by [DOMINGUEETAL2016]. The form of the function is
      given as:
 
      I/F = AN*exp[-(g*mu)]{c_sub_l[2cos i/(cos i + cos e)]+[1-c_sub_l]cos i}
 
      where i is solar incidence angle, e is emission angle, g is phase
      angle, AN is normal albedo at a given wavelength, mu and c_sub_l
      are wavelength-dependent parameters. Parameter values were fit using
      multiple regions between 24 degrees and 46 degrees south latitude
      and 330 degrees and 353 degrees east longitude. These regions sample
      incidence angle (i), emission angle(e), and phase angle (g)
      coverage commensurate with global mapping campaigns. In addition
      whole-disk Mercury images taken at a large number of geometries during
      the Mercury flybys expand the phase angle range. Parameter values were
      fit in the same manner as the parameters for the Hapke model. The
      values are given in the table below:

    Data
    ====
      There is one data type associated with this volume, an MP5 consisting
      of mosaicked, photometrically corrected WAC CDRs acquired through 5
      spectral filters, appended with 5 backplanes describing the component
      CDRs, their native spatial sampling scale, and their photometric
      geometries.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      There are two types of ancillary data provided with this
      dataset:
 
      1. The CALIB directory contains bandpasses of the spectral filters
      of MDIS used to collect the images in the dataset, to facilitate
      comparison with other data sets. See CALINFO.TXT in that directory
      for more details.
 
      2. There may be a BROWSE directory containing browse images in
      PNG and/or GeoTIFF format. See BROWINFO.TXT in that directory
      for more details.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      The cartographic coordinate system used for the MDIS data products
      conforms to the J2000 celestial reference frame for star imaging,
      and the IAU planetocentric system with East longitudes being
      positive for planetary surfaces. The IAU2000 reference system for
      cartographic coordinates and rotational elements is used for
      computing latitude and longitude coordinates of planets. The value
      for Mercury radius is 2439.4 km.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      The MDIS archive is organized and stored in the directory
      structure described in the Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS)
      Calibrated Data Record (CDR) and Reduced Data Record (RDR)
      Software Interface Specification (SIS). The contents of the
      archive, along with fiduciary checksums, are compressed into
      a single &apos;zip archive&apos; file for transmittal to the PDS Imaging
      node.  The zip archive preserves the directory structure
      internally so that when it is decompressed the original
      directory structure is recreated at the PDS Imaging node.
      The zip archive is transmitted to the PDS Imaging node via
      FTP to the URL specified by the node for receiving it.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      Known issues of concern are described below.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS). The
      peer review was conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
      Only a subset of raw EDR data are calibrated to CDRs and then
      incorporated into MP5 products. Briefly, the following criteria
      are met:
 
      (a) The data represent a scene and not the instrument test
      pattern, as indicated by data quality index (DQI) byte 0.
 
      (b) The exposure time is greater than zero (zero exposures
      occur in some images due to software features), as indicated
      by DQI byte 1.
 
      (c) Less than 20 percent of the image is saturated (empirically
      this is a threshold dividing wholly corrupted images from
      everything else).
 
      (d) The target of the image is MERCURY.
 
      (e) The image was taken as part of the 5-color mapping campaign
      represented by MP5 data products.
 
      The MP5 is based on version 5 CDRs which correct a number of earlier
      calibration artifacts. Those images may be subject to some or all
      of the following issues.
 
      (1) COMPRESSION ARTIFACTS. Wavelet compression applied to science
      images is lossy. At higher compression ratios, compression artifacts
      will degrade data precision over spatial scales comparable to or
      smaller than several pixels. The degradation can be greater
      proportionally to the image dynamic range of brightness, if the data
      are converted from 12 to 8 bits in such a way that a 1 DN error
      occupies a greater fraction of the digital dynamic range. Wavelet
      compression was used minimally prior to Mercury orbit. The initial
      configuration in Mercury orbit was to perform 12 to 8 bit conversion
      using LUT0 for the WAC and LUT2 for the NAC, with a wavelet
      compression ratio of 4:1 for color imaging. Initial images
      exhibited unexpectedly visible compression artifacts. Beginning
      19 April 2011, LUT0 and LUT2 were replaced with LUT1 which better
      preserves image dynamic range. Beginning 19 May 2011, targeted color
      images began to be acquired with lossless compression. Beginning
      31 May 2011, the wavelet compression ratio for color images was
      reduced to 3:1 for global mapping. All MP5 images are taken with
      LUT1 and a compression ratio of 3:1 or less.
 
      (2) RADIOMETRIC ACCURACY. The radiometric calibration of the
      WAC was updated several times over the mission to iteratively
      reduce residuals from 3 sources of error: (a) time-variable
      responsivity of the detector, (b) residuals in the flat-field
      correction, and (c) residuals in the correction to
      responsivity for detector temperature. For multispectral
      products, the residuals from time-variable responsivity
      initially led to distinct seams; correction of this artifact
      is treated in more detail below.
 
      In version 5 CDRs an improved temperature correction was
      derived empirically, by fitting as a function of CCD
      temperature, the median values of images acquired throughout
      Mercury orbit at a wide range of temperatures but a narrow range
      of photometric geometries. The flat field was updated
      empirically using the median of thousands of photometrically
      corrected images of relatively bland field-filling images
      of Mercury.
 
      (3) SCATTERED LIGHT. The WAC is subject to scattered light
      originating from within the field-of-view or just outside it. One
      source is multiple reflections off of 13 optical surfaces (2
      sides of each of 4 lenses, the spectral filter, and the CCD cover
      glass, as well as the CCD surface itself). The scatter becomes
      worse at longer wavelengths. Just off the limb of a large
      extended source near 1 field-of-view in size, like Venus or
      Mercury, measured radiance increases with wavelength from 2% to 7%
      of the value measured on the extended source. The value decreases
      with distance off the target more quickly at shorter than at
      longer wavelengths, but remains at 1% hundreds of pixels from
      the source. Conversely, light must be scattering from bright
      parts of an image to dark parts of an image. Averaged over
      sources tens of pixels in area, and away from abrupt brightness
      contrasts, scattered light affects shapes of spectra measured
      from WAC data at least at the 1-2% level, worse near brightness
      boundaries or for small, bright crater ejecta. The expected effect
      is enhanced brightness at &lt;650 nm in dark areas, and decreased
      brightness at &gt;650 nm in small bright areas.
 
      In the end-of-mission delivery 15, a forward model of the
      expected WAC scatter from a given scene was derived using
      optical design software modeling CCD structure and hardware,
      with magnitudes of scatter calibrated against flight measurements.
      The ray trace analysis reveals an in-scene component from light
      diffracted by the CCD and reflected by the CCD cover glass, and
      an out-of-scene component from light reflected off metallic
      surfaces alongside the CCD and back off the cover glass.
      Images with the worst scattered light were excluded from
      multispectral map products.
 
      (4) TIME-VARIABLE WAC RESPONSIVITY. During Mercury orbit it was
      recognized that filter-dependent changes in WAC responsivity on
      the order of +/- 15% occurred over timescales as short as several
      days. Because those variations were not consistent from filter to
      filter, they led to spurious spectral features, which were
      particularly conspicuous near 750 nm. The cause(s) of these
      variations in responsivity are not known, but they could include
      transient radiation effects on the detector or electronics, aging
      of filters, periodic deposition and burn-off of contaminants on
      filters, or incorrect recording of exposure time.
      For version 5 WAC CDRs used to create the MP5, an
      updated correction covers the full duration of the orbital
      phase. Overlaps between color image sets in color mapping campaigns
      were used to derive a multiplicative correction factor for each
      filter and for each Earth day (2-3 orbits). The version 1 MP5 uses
      CDRs with this updated correction. An analysis of overlap among
      individual images shows that residual differences (which include
      errors from calibration, scattered light, and possible incomplete
      correction of photometric variation) average &lt;2% for the majority
      of the planet.
 
      (5) MAP PROJECTION ERRORS. The MP5 is constructed from images
      controlled using c-smithed kernels and a global digital
      elevation model (DEM), both derived using a least-squares
      bundle adjustment of common features, measured as tie point
      coordinates in overlapping NAC and WAC-G filter images of Mercury
      at favorable solar incidence and emission angles.
      Empirically, misregistration errors between images
      are generally at the pixel scale of the map (0.2 km) in
      most locations. Derivation of smithed kernels and the DEM for
      end of mission data products is described by [BECKERETAL2016].
