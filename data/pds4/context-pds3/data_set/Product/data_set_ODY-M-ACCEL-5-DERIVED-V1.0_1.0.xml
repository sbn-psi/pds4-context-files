  Data Set Overview
  ==================
    This dataset consists of data products derived from data collected
    by the Accelerometer (ACC) on Mars Odyssey (ODY) during its
    aerobraking in the martian atmosphere. The DATA/ directory
    contains four subdirectories: DATA/RAW/, DATA/PROF/, DATA/ANC/
    and DATA/CALT/. DATA/RAW/ contains low rate and high rate data for
    each orbit. DATA/PROF/ contains density profiles for each orbit.
    DATA/ANC/ contains ancilliary information about each orbit.
    DATA/CALT/ contains densities and density scale heights at
    constant altitudes.
 
    Null values are 0 for numerical entries and YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS
    for time strings.
 
 
  Contents of DATA/RAW/ directory
  ===============================
    Filenames in the DATA/RAW/ subdirectory are ACCYYPXXX.ZZZ,
    where YY is either LO or HI, XXX is the orbit number and
    ZZZ is either LBL or TAB. If YY is LO, then the data file
    contains low rate data. If YY is HI, then the data file
    contains high rate data. Each data file contains data
    from one orbit.
 
    Each low rate data file contains time series of the
    following items.
 
    Time (UTC).                               TIME_LO_RAW
    Measured low-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +X direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AX_LO_RAW
    Measured low-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +Y direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AY_LO_RAW
    Measured low-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +Z direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AZ_LO_RAW
 
    Each high rate data file contains the following items.
 
    Time (UTC).                               TIME_HI_RAW
    Measured high-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +X direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AX_HI_RAW
    Measured high-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +Y direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AY_HI_RAW
    Measured high-rate acceleration (m/s^2) in
      +Z direction of M01_SPACECRAFT frame.   AZ_HI_RAW
 
    No uncertainties are included in either type of data file.
 
 
  Production of files in the DATA/RAW/ directory
  ==============================================
    Low rate data have been delivered to the PDS Atmospheres Node
    in a non-standard format, but have not yet been peer-reviewed
    nor accepted into the PDS
    (ftp://atmos.nmsu.edu/odyssey/level0/data/). Acceleration
    measurements for orbit XXX were provided in an ASCII
    file (pXXXacc.txt) that contains time in YY/DOY-HH:MM:SS.SSS
    format and x, y, and z-axis accelerations in m s^(-2). There
    is no accompanying documentation, so the time standard and
    reference frame required to use the data have to be identified
    by other means. Many different time standards are used by
    spacecraft missions. These times were confirmed to be UTC
    times, not barycentric dynamical times or ephemeris times
    (ET), by reproduction of published plots of acceleration/density
    versus time since periapsis for P076 [TOLSONETAL2005].
    We assumed that the x, y, and z-axes were those of the
    &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame defined by Navigation and Ancillary
    Information Facility (NAIF) SPICE kernel m01_v28.tf, which is
    identical to the Lockheed Martin (LMA) &apos;mechanical coordinate system&apos;
    for ODY [TAKASHIMA2002]. The &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame
    and LMA &apos;mechanical coordinate system&apos; are identical to the
    &apos;spacecraft frame&apos; described in the PDS instrument host file
    for ODY (versions created after 14 March 2003). The LMA
    &apos;mechanical coordinate system&apos; and a POST &apos;body-frame coordinate
    system&apos; are also defined in [CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005].
    Accelerometer data were transferred from pXXXacc.txt to
    ACCLOPXXX.TAB without further processing.
 
    High rate data have been delivered to the PDS Atmospheres Node
    in a non-standard format, but have not yet been peer-reviewed
    nor accepted into the PDS (ftp:atmos.nmsu.edu/odyssey/level0/data/).
    Acceleration measurements for orbit XXX were provided in a
    MATLAB file (LOPXXX.mat). Some documentation was provided in
    Microsoft Excel and Word files. We extracted variables HiACCTime
    and HiACC from each orbit&apos;s LOPXXX.mat file. According to the
    documentation, HiACCTime is time expressed as UTC seconds past
    J2000. These were confirmed to be UTC seconds, not ET seconds,
    by reproduction of published plots of acceleration/density
    versus time since periapsis for P076 [TOLSONETAL2005].
    According to the documentation, HiACC is x, y, and z-axis
    accelerations in m s^(-2). These accelerations are similar to
    the low-rate accelerations, which suggests that they are
    expressed in the same coordinate system. Therefore we again
    assumed that the x, y, and z-axes were those of the
    &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame defined by SPICE kernel m01_v28.tf,
    which is identical to the Lockheed Martin (LMA) mechanical
    coordinate system for ODY [TAKASHIMA2002].
    Accelerometer data were transferred from LOPXXX.mat to
    ACCHIPXXX.TAB without further processing.
 
 
  Contents of DATA/PROF/ directory
  ================================
    Filenames in the DATA/PROF/ subdirectory are ACCPROFPXXX.ZZZ
    where XXX is the orbit number and ZZZ is either LBL or TAB.
    Each data file contains data from one orbit.
 
    Each profile data file contains time series of the
    following items.
 
    UTC time.                                         TIME_UTC

  Production of files in the DATA/PROF/ directory
  ===============================================
    We extracted the low rate and high rate data from files in
    DATA/RAW/, then discarded some isolated data points. High rate
    data for hundreds of orbits contain gaps of &gt;30s towards the end
    of the outbound leg. Data after these gaps were discarded. There
    is an additional gap of &gt;5s towards the end of the outbound leg
    in high rate data for both P109 and P173. Data after these gaps
    were discarded. There is a gap of 3s between the last and
    penultimate data points in orbits 26, 27, 28, 38, 69, 74,
    123, 155, 170, 179-189, 249, 273, 276, 285, 292, 297, 299,
    301, 303, 305, and 306. The last data point was discarded in
    these orbits. Gaps of 1s-2s in the high rate data remain in
    about 20% of the orbits. These are short enough that their
    effects are minimal, so the data were not modified to correct for
    them. This completes step 1 (data cleaning) of the data processing.
 
    No data were delivered to the PDS for orbits 1, 2, 3, 5, and 327.
    The possibility that data were acquired, but omitted from the
    dataset delivered to the PDS, for these orbits can be excluded.
    During aerobraking operations, &apos;Quick Look Reports&apos; were
    generated by the ACC team within hours of each periapsis
    pass in support of mission operations. These reports summarized
    ACC measurements from a given aerobraking pass. No &apos;Quick Look
    Reports&apos; were generated for these orbits, which suggests that
    no useful data were received on the ground.
 
    Low rate data, but not high rate data, exist for orbits 4,
    57, 158, 213, 255, 266, 289, and 336. The high rate data stream
    for orbit 137 begins well inside the atmosphere, close to
    periapsis, and contains measurements at 4 s intervals instead
    of the usual 1 s intervals. The low rate data for orbit 137
    are normal. Data for orbits 4 (low rate only, periapsis
    altitude = 290 km) and 6 (low rate and high rate, periapsis
    altitude = 160 km) exist, but aerodynamic accelerations cannot
    be separated from non-aerodynamic accelerations when altitudes
    are so high and aerodynamic drag is so weak. Results for orbits
    1-336 used the following data streams: no results for orbits
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 327; results based on low rate data for
    orbits 57, 137, 158, 213, 255, 266, 289 and 336; and results
    based on high rate data for all other orbits.
 
    Interpretation of the ACC measurements requires knowledge of
    ODY&apos;s position, velocity and orientation. The position, velocity,
    and orientation of ODY in an inertial reference frame during
    aerobraking were obtained from SPICE kernels m01_ab.bsp,
    m01_sc_ab0110.bc, m01_sc_ab0111.bc, m01_sc_ab0112.bc,
    m01_sc_ab0201.bc, and m01_sc_ab0202.bc.
    The position and orientation of Mars in an inertial reference
    frame were obtained from SPICE kernels de414.bsp and pck00008.tpc.
    Time-related SPICE kernels naif0008.tls and orb1_sclkscet_00129.tsc
    were also used in this work. The velocity of the martian
    atmosphere, assuming that it rotates with the solid body of
    the planet, in an inertial reference frame was calculated
    using these SPICE kernels. The velocity of the atmosphere
    relative to the spacecraft and of the spacecraft relative to
    the atmosphere can be determined from this information.
    Spacecraft altitude was defined as the magnitude of vector P,
    which is defined as vector A minus vector B. Vector A is the
    vector position of ODY relative to the centre of mass of Mars.
    Vector B is the vector position of a point on a pre-defined
    martian areoid relative to the centre of mass of Mars and
    vector A is parallel to vector B. In this work, the MOLA
    0.25 x 0.25 degree areoid was used [SMITHETAL2003B].
    Periapsis is defined in this work as the point of minimum
    altitude, not minimum radial distance.
 
    SPICE kernels for ODY&apos;s orientation are not available on
    28 November 2001, which encompasses aerobraking passes on
    orbits 58 and 59. ODY&apos;s attitude on these orbits was assumed
    to be phi = 0 degrees and theta = -4 degrees, where phi and theta
    are defined later [TOLSONETAL2005]. This attitude, the nominal
    trim attitude, is consistent with ODY&apos;s average attitude for
    neighbouring orbits.
 
    Figures of orbit number, periapsis latitude, altitude,
    local solar time (LST) and Ls are contained in [TOLSONETAL2005]
    and [TOLSONETAL2007]. Ls is the aerocentric longitude of the
    Sun, a measure of the martian season. Ls is 0 degrees at the
    northern spring equinox, 90 degrees at the northern summer
    solstice, 180 degrees at the northern autumn equinox and
    270 degrees at the northern winter solstice. These figures
    show that the ODY ACC measurements separate naturally into
    two subsets - dayside and nightside. In this work, &apos;dayside&apos;
    corresponds to 12 hours &lt; LST &lt; 24 hours and &apos;nightside&apos;
    corresponds to 0 hours &lt; LST &lt; 12 hours. The boundary between
    dayside and nightside is not the same as the terminator that
    separates the sunlit and shadowed hemispheres. Sub-solar
    latitude changed from -24.9 degrees N to -20.1 degrees N during
    ODY aerobraking, so all latitudes poleward of 65.1 degrees N
    (69.9 degrees N) were in darkness in the polar night at the
    start (end) of aerobraking.
 
    We wish to derive atmospheric densities, rho, from aerodynamic
    accelerations, vector aaero. Measured accelerations, vector
    ameas, are not identical to vector aaero. They are related by:
 
    vector ameas = vector aaero + vector abias +                   (1)
                    vector agg + vector athr +
                    vector omega x (vector omega x vector r) +
                    vector omega-dot x vector r
 
    Vector abias represents the effect of sensor bias, vector agg,
    which is called the gravity gradient term, represents the
    effect of differences between the acceleration due to
    gravity at the sensor and at the spacecraft&apos;s centre of mass,
    vector athr represents the effect of reaction control system
    (RCS) thruster firings, vector omega is the angular velocity of
    the spacecraft, vector r is the position of the accelerometer
    with respect to the spacecraft&apos;s centre of mass, vector
    omega-dot is the rate of change of vector omega, and the last
    two terms represent the effects of angular motion of the
    sensor about the spacecraft&apos;s centre of mass. The derivation
    of atmospheric densities uses only the y-axis component of
    vector aaero, so we focus on the y-axis component of
    Equation 1. We now address each term in Equation 1.
 
    The two angular acceleration terms can, in principle, be
    calculated. SPICE orientation information is sufficient to
    determine vector omega and vector omega-dot. However, we
    do not know vector r accurately. The positions of the
    accelerometer and the centre of mass were measured before
    launch. The accelerometer has not moved since then, but the
    centre of mass has. Fuel consumption causes a secular change
    in centre of mass position. Accelerations experienced during
    aerobraking cause the fuel to slosh back and forth in the
    tanks, which also alters the centre of mass position. Rapid
    changes in vector r could introduce an additional term, a
    Coriolis term, into Equation 1. According to [TOLSONETAL2005],
    the accelerometer position is (x,y,z) = (0.164, -0.544, 1.137)
    metres relative to the centre of mass. However, the reference
    frame for this position is not defined. The frame
    suggested by Figure 1 of [TOLSONETAL2005] is not consistent
    with either the &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame or the &apos;body
    coordinate system&apos;
    [TAKASHIMA2002, CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005].
    According to [CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005], the accelerometer
    position at the midpoint of aerobraking was (x,y,z) =
    (-0.629, -0.0172, 1.1) metres relative to the centre of
    mass in the &apos;body coordinate system.&apos; This is (x,y,z) =
    (0.0172, 0.629, -1.1) metres relative to the centre of mass
    in the &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame. It is likely that the
    frame used by [TOLSONETAL2005] differs from the
    &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame by a factor of -1, which makes
    their accelerometer position (x,y,z) = (0.164, -0.544, 1.137)
    metres relative to the centre of mass. We do not correct
    vector ameas for the two angular acceleration terms,
    therefore angular accelerations influence the uncertainty
    in vector ameas.
 
    Vector athr is &apos;two orders of magnitude less than the
    periapsis drag effect&apos; [TOLSONETAL2005]. The typical
    acceleration at periapsis is 2E-2 m s^(-2), so the thruster
    term is on the order of 2E-4 m s^(-2). The nominal impulse,
    I, generated by a single RCS thruster firing is approximately
    I = 0.00804038 t + 0.02125765, where t is the duration of the
    thruster firing in milliseconds and I is in N-sec
    [MASE&amp;BURKHART2000]. There are four RCS thrusters, labelled
    RCS1 to RCS4. The change in ODY&apos;s velocity due to an RCS
    thruster firing, vector Delta-v, equals I x vector e / m
    where m is ODY&apos;s mass and vector e is a unit vector.
    For RCS1, vector e = (-X, Y, -Z). For RCS2, vector e =
    (-X, -Y, -Z). For RCS3, vector e = (X, -Y, -Z). For
    RCS4, vector e = (X, Y, -Z).
    X = 0.8926, Y = 0.4162, and Z = 0.1736 [MASE&amp;BURKHART2000].
    These unit vectors are in the &apos;M01_SPACECRAFT&apos; frame.
    Thruster firings for orbit XXX are reported in ASCII
    files (pXXXthot.txt) that accompany the low rate accelerometer
    data. The cumulative times that each thruster has fired for are
    listed as functions of time. Typical thruster firings last for
    0.1 sec, much less than the typical interval between cumulative
    times in pXXXthot.txt (1-10 sec). Since the times of thruster
    activity cannot be resolved, their contributions cannot be
    removed from the measured accelerations. Also, the actual
    impulse produced by a thruster will differ from the nominal
    impulse. Past experience has shown that determination of
    thruster impulse to within 50% is difficult [TOLSONETAL2005].
    We do not correct vector ameas for thruster activity.
 
    Vector agg is on the order of 1E-6 m s^(-2) [CANCROETAL1998].
    This is much smaller than vector athr, so we neglect it.
 
    When ODY is far outside the atmosphere, vector ameas = vector
    abias. Pre-entry and post-exit measured accelerations can
    be used to estimate instrument bias. Scatter in ameas,lo,y
    (the y-component of the low rate measured acceleration) was
    large enough that estimates of abias,lo,y could not be
    distinguished from zero. ameas,lo,y was not corrected for bias.
    abias,hi,y was calculated from pre-entry and post-exit
    accelerations. The pre-entry value of abias,hi,y was
    assumed to be the mean of all ameas,hi,y measurements from 10s
    after the start of the data stream to 60s later. The post-exit
    value of abias,hi,y was assumed to be the mean of all ameas,hi,y
    measurements from 70s before the end of the data stream to
    60s later. These time ranges were chosen to ensure that
    aerodynamic accelerations and any transients associated with
    the beginning/end of the data stream were negligible. The
    typical pre-entry bias was -2.4E-4 m s^(-2) and the typical
    post-exit bias was -2.2E-4 m s^(-2). abias,hi,y was assumed to
    vary linearly with time during an aerobraking pass. The
    post-exit bias was assumed to equal the pre-entry bias
    for orbits 84, 91, 93, and 95 due to lack of adequate post-exit
    data. We correct vector ameas for bias for high rate data only.
 
    Thus aaero,lo,y = ameas,lo,y and aaero,hi,y =
    ameas,hi,y - abias,hi,y. This completes step 2
    (data correction) of the data processing.
 
    We next formed 7-point and 39-point running means of
    aaero,lo,y and aaero,hi,y, effectively 7-s and 39-s averages,
    and labelled them aaero,lo,y,7; aaero,lo,y,39; aaero,hi,y,7
    and aaero,hi,y,39. This reduced the noise in the accelerations
    at the expense of spatial resolution. The duration of the
    39-point time series is shorter than the duration of the
    7-point time series, which is shorter than the duration of
    the unaveraged time series, because a 7-point running mean
    cannot be calculated for the first three data points in a
    series of measurements.
 
    The noise inherent in aaero,lo,y; aaero,hi,y; aaero,lo,y,7;
    aaero,hi,y,7; aaero,lo,y,39 and aaero,hi,y,39 was estimated
    based on the standard deviation of selected pre-entry
    measurements. Measurements from 30s after the start of the
    time series to 60s later were used for aaero,lo,y; aaero,lo,y,7
    and aaero,lo,y,39. Measurements from 10s after the start of
    the time series to 200s later were used for aaero,hi,y.
    Measurements from 10s after the start of the time series to
    100s later were used for aaero,hi,y,7. Measurements from
    30s after the start of the time series to 60s later were
    used for aaero,hi,y,39. The start times of these time series
    were chosen to ensure that transients associated with the
    beginning of the data stream did not affect any of the
    calculated noise values. The end times of these time series
    were chosen to ensure that aerodynamic accelerations did not
    affect any of the calculated noise values. These time series
    were made as long as possible to increase the accuracy of the
    noise calculation.
 
    Noise levels depend on the number of samples acquired per second:
    200 for orbits 1-136, 50 for orbits 137-268 and 20 for
    orbits 269-330. The ratio of noise levels in aaero,hi,y for
    orbits 269-330 to orbits 1-136 is 6.05, significantly greater
    than the square root of the ratio 200/20, or 3.16, that
    would occur for samples from a Gaussian distribution.
    The ratio of noise levels in aaero,hi,y for orbits 137-268
    to orbits 1-136 is 3.28, significantly greater than the
    square root of the ratio 200/50, or 2, that would occur for
    samples from a Gaussian distribution. The ratio of noise
    levels in aaero,hi,y for orbits 269-330 to orbits 137-268 is
    1.84, close to the square root of the ratio 50/20, or 1.58,
    that would occur for samples from a Gaussian distribution.
    This suggests that scatter in aaero,hi,y for orbits 137-330,
    but not for orbits 1-136, can be considered to be Gaussian noise.
 
    Useful data are data that are clearly dominated by aerodynamic
    acceleration, not other factors such as instrument noise,
    the effects of thrusters, and the effects of angular
    accelerations. We process the dataset to remove those
    data points that are not useful.
 
    Accelerations due to thrusters are on the order of 2E-4 m s^(-2).
    Let the magnitudes of the y-component of the two angular
    acceleration terms in Equation 1 be Y1 and Y2 respectively. We
    estimate Y1 and Y2 using angular rate information from
    SPICE and vector r. We tested two values for vector r, both
    assumed to be in the M01_SPACECRAFT frame, vector r =
    (0.164, -0.544, 1.137) metres [TOLSONETAL2005] and
    vector r = (0.0172, 0.629, -1.1) [CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005].
    Differences in Y1 and Y2 are relatively small, and we adopted
    the value derived from [TOLSONETAL2005].
 
    Data points that were smaller than a threshold were deemed
    to be not useful. The threshold was calculated for each
    time step and each of the six sets of accelerations
    (aaero,lo,y; aaero,lo,y,7; aaero,lo,y,39; aaero,hi,y;
    aaero,hi,y,7 and aaero,hi,y,39). The threshold was the largest
    of (A) the relevant noise level, (B) 2E-4 m s^(-2), (C) Y1 and
    (D) Y2. Angular accelerations determine threshold values near
    periapsis when accelerations significantly exceed threshold
    values. Further from periapsis, the time at which accelerations
    cross the threshold is controlled by either the effects of
    thrusters (aaero,lo,y,7; aaero,lo,y,39; orbits 7-136 of
    aaero,hi,y; aaero,hi,y,7 and aaero,hi,y,39) or by noise
    (aaero,lo,y and orbits 137-336 of aaero,hi,y). Thus the vertical
    range of ODY density profiles is not affected by angular
    accelerations or choice of vector r.
 
    Data points that were smaller than their corresponding thresholds
    were discarded. This sometimes resulted in large gaps in the time
    series of retained data points, which is not desirable. To correct
    this, additional data points were discarded as necessary to ensure
    that the time series of retained data points was continuous.
    For example, suppose that data points at t &lt; -100s did not exceed
    their thresholds, data points at -100s &lt; t &lt; -90s exceeded their
    thresholds, data points at -90s &lt; t &lt; -80s did not exceed their
    thresholds, data points at -80s &lt; t &lt; +100s exceeded their
    thresholds and data points at t &gt; +100s did not exceed their
    thresholds. Data points at -80s &lt; t &lt; +100s would be retained,
    but all other data points would be discarded, including data
    points at -100s &lt; t &lt; -90s. Each retained data point was
    assigned an uncertainty equal to its corresponding threshold.
    This completes step 3 (data selection) of the data processing.
 
    The atmospheric density, rho, satisfies:
 
    m x |aaero,y| = 0.5 rho V^2 Cy A                               (2)
 
    where m is the spacecraft mass, aaero,y is the y-component of
    the aerodynamic acceleration, V is the scalar speed of the
    spacecraft relative to the atmosphere, or vice versa, Cy is
    an aerodynamic coefficient, and A is a reference area
    connected with Cy [WITHERSETAL2003A]. Similar equations exist
    for all directions. We use the y-axis in the M01_SPACECRAFT
    frame since acceleration measurements along this axis,
    which is close to the velocity of the spacecraft relative
    to the atmosphere, have the greatest signal-to-noise ratio.
 
    m decreased monotonically from 460.8 kg at the start of
    aerobraking to 451.7 kg at the end (pers. comm, Mase, 2006).
    Uncertainty in the absolute mass is 3 kg, although the
    change in mass from one orbit to the next orbit is known much
    more accurately (&lt;1 g). A is 11.03 m^2 [CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005].
    V is known from SPICE information. The product rho x Cy can
    be found using measured or known quantities (m, aaero,y, V,
    and A) at each time step along an aerobraking pass.
 
    Next, rho and Cy are determined from the product rho x Cy.
    ODY&apos;s Cy, typically about 2, is a function of density and
    the attitude of the spacecraft with respect to its velocity
    relative to the atmosphere. Spacecraft attitude can be
    expressed as two angles, phi and theta. If the velocity of
    the atmosphere relative to the spacecraft is vector U =
    scalar U x vector u, where vector u is a unit vector
    expressed in the M01_SPACECRAFT frame, then pitch (theta) and
    yaw (phi) angles are defined by [TAKASHIMA2002].
 
    ux = cos(theta) sin(phi)                                       (3)
    uy = cos(theta) cos(phi)                                       (4)
    uz = - sin(theta)                                              (5)
 
    Values of Cy for various rho, phi, and theta have been
    determined by numerical simulation. These values constitute
    the &apos;aerodynamic database.&apos; The aerodynamic database was
    reported in [TAKASHIMA&amp;WILMOT2002] and provided to us by
    R. Mase (pers. comm., 2006). Uncertainties in Cy are
    estimated to be 3% [CHAVIS&amp;WILMOTH2005]. Inputs to the
    numerical simulations ranged from 1E-4 kg km^(-3) to
    1E4 kg km^(-3) for rho, from -60 degrees to +60 degrees for
    phi, and -60 degrees to +60 degrees for theta. These ranges
    encompassed all conditions encountered during aerobraking.
    We found the unit vector u as a function of time for each
    aerobraking pass. Angles phi and theta were then determined
    using Equations 3-5, also as functions of time for each
    aerobraking pass. At each time step in each aerobraking pass,
    the simulated value of Cy was found as a function of rho
    using the aerodynamic database. The simulated value of the
    product rho x Cy was also found as a function of rho.
 
    rho x Cy is a single-valued function of rho for any specified
    phi and theta, which enables both rho and Cy to be found from
    rho x Cy. At each time step in each aerobraking pass, the
    observed value of the product rho x Cy and the simulated
    function rho x Cy(rho) were compared to determine the value
    of rho. The value of Cy followed trivially. This technique is
    also discussed by [TAKASHIMA&amp;WILMOT2002] and [TOLSONETAL2005].
 
    This process was applied to aaero,lo,y; aaero,hi,y;
    aaero,lo,y,7; aaero,hi,y,7; aaero,lo,y,39 and aaero,hi,y,39
    to obtain rho,lo; rho,hi; rho,lo,7; rho,hi,7; rho,lo,39 and
    rho,hi,39. Uncertainties in each of these densities were
    found using [BEVINGTON1969].
 
    (sigma,rho / rho)^2 = (sigma,m / m)^2 + (sigma,Cy / Cy)^2 +    (6)
                          (sigma,a / a)^2
 
    where sigma,rho is the uncertainty in density rho and
    sigma,a is the uncertainty in the corresponding acceleration a.
    Derived densities that were smaller than their uncertainties
    were discarded. This sometimes resulted in large gaps in the
    time series of retained densities, which is not desirable.
    To correct this, other derived densities were discarded as
    necessary to ensure that the time series of retained densities
    was continuous. For example, suppose that densities at
    t &lt; -100s did not exceed their uncertainties, densities at
    -100s &lt; t &lt; -90s exceeded their uncertainties, densities at
    -90s &lt; t &lt; -80s did not exceed their uncertainties, densities
    at -80s &lt; t &lt; +100s exceeded their uncertainties and densities
    at t &gt; +100s did not exceed their uncertainties. Densities at
    -80s &lt; t &lt; +100s would be retained, but all other densities
    would be discarded, including densities at -100s &lt; t &lt; -90s.
    This completes step 4 (density derivation) of the data processing.
 
    Each aerobraking pass has up to six derived density profiles:
    rho,lo; rho,hi; rho,lo,7; rho,hi,7; rho,lo,39 and rho,hi,39.
    Each derived density value has an associated altitude.
 
    Derived densities rely on knowledge of the speed and direction
    of the spacecraft relative to the atmosphere. The velocity of
    ODY in an inertial frame is determined from SPICE information.
    The velocity of the atmosphere in an inertial frame is determined
    from the assumption that the atmosphere rotates at the same
    angular velocity as the solid planet. This assumption is not
    accurate. Models predict zonal and meridional winds of about
    100 m s^(-1) at aerobraking altitudes
    [BOUGHERETAL1999, BOUGHERETAL2000, BOUGHERETAL2002]. These
    speeds are consistent with results from the first efforts
    to determine winds from aerobraking measurements
    [BAIRDETAL2007, CROWLEY&amp;TOLSON2007].
 
    If, instead of assuming solid body rotation for the
    atmosphere, we assume that there is a zonal wind of
    100 m s^(-1), then derived densities are altered by &lt;1%. A
    meridional wind of 100 m s^(-1) alters derived densities by
    about 5%. Data users should be aware of this potential source
    of error, which is not included in the derived uncertainties
    (Equation 6) because the accuracy of wind predictions has not
    been quantified.

    despite the existence of ACC data for orbits P004 and P006,

  Production of files in the DATA/CALT/ directory
  ===============================================
    The 1-second sampling rate (&lt;1 km vertical resolution) in the
    derived density profiles is not necessary for many studies of
    large-scale atmospheric processes. Another dataset of reduced
    size, called the constant altitude dataset, was generated from
    rho,39 data to support such studies. Orbits for which rho,hi,39
    data were available used rho,hi,39 data. Orbits for which
    rho,hi,39 data were not available used rho,lo,39 data.
 
    rho,39 measurements for a given orbit were first split in two.
    All densities before periapsis, including the periapsis density,
    were assigned to the inbound leg. All densities after periapsis,
    including the periapsis density, were assigned to the outbound
    leg. Each leg was processed separately. Target altitudes were
    defined as 100 km, 110 km, 120 km, 130 km,  140 km, 150 km, and
    160 km. Periapsis never reached 90 km. If density measurements
    existed more than 3 km below the target altitude and more than
    3 km above the target altitude, then we proceeded to determine
    constant altitude data products for that target altitude.
 
    We assume that densities, rho, within 5 km of the target
    altitude, z0, satisfy:
 
    rho = rho0 x exp( -(z-z0) / Hrho )                             (7)
 
    where rho0 is the density at z0 and Hrho is the density scale
    height between z0 - 5 km and z0 + 5 km. Equivalently:
 
    ln rho = ln rho0 + (-1 / Hrho) x (z-z0)                        (8)
 
    Defining y = ln rho, x = z - z0, a = ln rho0 and b = -1/Hrho,
    we have:
 
    y = a + b x                                                    (9)
 
    Values of x, the independent variable, are known exactly.
    Values of y, the dependent variable have uncertainties
    sigma,y = sigma,rho / rho. We use standard least-squares
    techniques, Equation 6-12 of [BEVINGTON1969] as implemented by
    the IDL POLY_FIT procedure, to determine best-fit values of
    a and b, and uncertainties sigma,a and sigma,b. Then we have
    [BEVINGTON1969]:
 
    rho0 = exp(a)                                                  (10)
 
    sigma,rho0 = sigma,a x rho0                                    (11)
 
    Hrho = -1 / b                                                  (12)
 
    sigma,Hrho = Hrho x Hrho x sigma,b                             (13)
 
    Assuming an isothermal atmosphere, temperature, Trho, and its
    uncertainty, sigma,Trho, were estimated from the fitted density
    scale height, Hrho, using:
 
    Trho = ( mu g Hrho ) / kB                                      (14)
 
    sigma,Trho / Trho = sigma,Hrho / Hrho                          (15)
 
    where mu is mean molecular mass, assumed to be 43.49 daltons,
    g is the acceleration due to gravity, and kB is Boltzmann&apos;s
    constant. The assumed mu, which corresponds to Viking Lander
    measurements at the surface, is an overestimate
    [OWEN1992, MAGALHAESETAL1999]. Light species such as O are
    more abundant in the thermosphere than near the surface. Data
    users who wish to make a different assumption concerning mu
    can simply multiply our Trho and sigma,Trho by the ratio of
    their desired mean molecular mass to 43.49 daltons.
    g is given by:
 
    g = GM / (Rref + z)^2                                          (16)
 
    where Rref is the mean equatorial radius of the MOLA areoid
    used in this work, 3396 km, G is the gravitational constant,
    and M is the mass of Mars [SMITHETAL2003B].
    GM = 4.2828382332E13 m^3 s^(-2) [TYLERETAL2000B].
 
    No fitted rho, Hrho, or Trho had a smaller absolute value
    than its uncertainty. One set of results for Hrho and Trho was
    negative (orbit 12, outbound 130 km, Hrho = -75 km,
    sigma,Hrho = 29 km, Trho = -1340K, sigma,Trho = 480K). Recall
    that aerobraking passes are not vertical; they span significant
    horizontal extent. Densities do decrease with altitude at 130
    km on the outbound leg of this aerobraking pass, presumably
    due to some kind of wave in the atmosphere, so this negative
    scale height is formally accurate. However, this illustrates
    that caution should be used when interpreting scale heights
    derived from non-vertical density profiles. Fitted values of
    rho cannot be negative, due to the exponential fitting approach.
 
    Results were obtained at 110 km and 120 km for almost all orbits,
    at 100 km for &gt;50% of orbits, and at 140 km outbound for &gt;20% of
    orbits. Results at 150 km and 160 km are essentially non-existent.
    Accelerations were measured at 140 km on outbound legs at
    daytime LSTs more frequently than at 140 km on inbound legs,
    and the difference between daytime and nighttime densities at
    140 km explains why there are so many more outbound 140 km
    measurements than inbound 140 km measurements.

  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    Geographical coverage is described by [TOLSONETAL2005].
    Vertical extent is approximately 90 km to 160 km.
    Gaps in time series data have been discussed earlier in this
    file. No erroneous data points remained after step 1 of the
    data processing. Uncertainties in measured accelerations
    have been inferred from the available data and documentation.
    Additional information may exist that could improve the
    accuracy of the uncertainties. As discussed earlier in this
    file, low rate accelerometer data, which are noisier than
    high rate accelerometer data were used for orbits that
    lacked high rate accelerometer data. Estimated effects of
    thrusters and angular accelerations have been used to
    truncate data series, but have not been removed.
    Attitude information was not available for orbits P058
    and P059, so the nominal attitude was assumed.
    Uncertainties are reported for all data products.
 
 
  Limitations and Caveats
  =======================
    The effects of winds on the speed of the spacecraft relative
    to the atmosphere have not been included. These may affect
    densities by 5%. These density profiles are not vertical profiles,
    they have significant horizontal extent. That affects interpretation
    of apparent vertical trends. Waves in density profiles can prevent
    fitted densities and density scale heights from representing the
    mean state of the atmosphere. For example, an unusually large
    density scale height may be caused by a wave, not high temperatures
    and associated small changes in background density with altitude.
