  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains magnetic-field data acquired during the
    cruise and tour phases of the Cassini mission to Saturn. The data
    set begins with data collected on 16 August (day 228), 1999 and ends
    on 17 November (day 321), 2005 when the instrument failed.
    On 16 August, 1999 two days before the spacecraft commenced Earth
    swingby, the magnetometer boom was unfurled into its extended
    position; a  configuration it maintained for the remainder of the
    mission.  Magnetic-field data acquired prior to boom deployment are
    limited and are significantly affected by spacecraft noise. These
    data are of no scientific value and, consequently, do not form part
    of this data set.
 
    Cassini carried two magnetometers: a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)
    and a vector-helium magnetometer capable of operating in both
    vector and scalar mode (V/SHM). This data set contains the magnetic-
    field and calibration data recorded by these two instruments,
    together with supplementary instrument and spacecraft data. The data
    are divided into time periods of one day and saved in files using
    the UCLA flatfile system. In this system, data are recorded in
    binary files that have associated text header files describing the
    format and content of the data.
 
    The magnetic-field data are contained in the FGM, VHM and SHM data
    products which can be identified from the &apos;mrdcd&apos; in their file names.
    The FGM and VHM data are raw data which may be calibrated using the Cal02
    software package provided in the /SOFTWARE directory and the calibration
    files in the /CALIB directory. The SHM submitted is already calibrated.
    The calibrated data may optionally be transformed into a range of
    coordinate systems (see below) using the TransCal software package in
    conjunction with SPICE kernels available from the Navigation and
    Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF). Spacecraft attitude data
    contained in the CHATT data files which can be identified from the
    &apos;ecdcd&apos; in their file names may be used in lieu of the SPICE C kernel.
 
    Additional data, such as analog, command validation, configuration
    image, error counter and user-defined engineering data, are included
    in this archive for completeness and are not required for processing
    the magnetic-field data.
 
    Data are received from Cassini in science or housekeeping telemetry
    packets. Data from both these streams form part of this data set. The
    naming convention used for data files allows the telemetry source and
    date of acquisition to be readily determined from the file name. On any
    given date, the science and housekeeping data for a particular
    magnetometer cover the same time interval to within a few seconds.
    Science and housekeeping data files have identical formats and are
    processed in exactly the same way.
 
    The magnetic-field data have been extracted from telemetry
    packets, assigned time tags, and formatted into simple binary tables
    of values in engineering units (data numbers). The data are provided
    in sensor coordinates. Software included with this archive may be
    used to convert these data to nanoTesla and tranform them into
    alternative time and coordinate systems.
 
    The full set of MAG data products is
    Data    Description
    FGM     Vector data from fluxgate magnetometer
    VHM     Vector data from helium magnetometer
    SHM     Scalar data from helium magnetometer
    ANA     Analog data from magnetometer control unit
    CMD     Command validation information
    CON     Configuration image data from MAG DPU
    ERR     Error counter information
    CHATT   Channelised attitude data for spacecraft
    CHUSR   Channelised user-defined engineering data
 
 
    The format of files containing these data products is described in full
    in the archive volume SIS, found on this volume called the &apos;THE CASSINI
    MAGNETIC FIELD INVESTIGATION&apos; by Dougherty et al.
 
  Data

  Data Parameters
  ===============
    Magnetic-field units
    --------------------
    The units of the preprocessed magnetic-field data are given as
    nanoTesla (nT). They represent the X, Y, and Z sensor values at
    the given time. These values were converted into nT using the
    following:
 
    FGM and VHM:   nT = (value - 8192) / 8192 * factor.
 
    The value of the factor is determined from the range given with
    each vector using the following table:
 
 
            Range    FGM Factor   VHM Factor
                0           40          32
                1          400         256
                2        10000          -
                3        44000          -

    MAG times
    ---------
    The Cassini spacecraft clock (SCLK) is a counter that advances by
    one tick nominally every 1/256 seconds. SCLK times have the format
    cccc:ttt, in which cccc specifies the number of full counts that
    have elapsed (one full count = 256 ticks), and ttt indicates by how
    many ticks the clock has advanced towards the next count, since the
    epoch 00:00:00Z 1 January 1958.
 
    SCLK counts may also include a partition number, p/cccc:ttt.
    This number is initially 1 but is incremented during the mission if
    the SCLK counter is reset or somehow interrupted or altered. The
    following discussion assumes a partition number of 1. For other
    partition numbers, the determination of SCLK times requires
    knowledge of the time at which the current partition was initiated.
 
    SCLK times are commonly recorded in MAG files as decimal
    counts. Time may also be represented in MAG files as Spacecraft
    Event Time (SCET) which, for Cassini, is Universal Time Coordinated
    (UTC). The relationship between SCLK and SCET/UTC is dependent on
    the count rate of the Cassini SCLK. Like most counter-based clocks,
    this rate is not constant but drifts with time. Consequently,
    conversion of SCLK times to SCET/UTC times requires knowledge of the
    drift rates. These rates are recorded in the SCLK/SCET coefficients
    file maintained by the Cassini Spacecraft Operations (SCO) team at
    JPL. As the Cassini mission progresses, the difference between SCLK
    and SCET will typically be of order tens of minutes.
 
    Times in MAG data files
 
    The times associated with magnetic-field vectors in MAG data files
    are SCLK counts since epoch 1958.
 
    The times associated with magnetic-field scalar values in MAG data files
    are SCET in seconds since epoch 2000 in TAI (International Atomic Time)
 
    Times in MAG header files
 
 
    FIRST TIME SCLK time of first record in data file;
    derived from primary header of CHDO file
 
 
    LAST TIME SCLK time of last record in data file; derived
    from primary header of CHDO file
 
 
    SCLK (in ABSTRACT) SCLK count obtained from tertiary
    header of CHDO file; also converted into year, day of year, month,
    date, time format; may differ from FIRST TIME by some minutes
 
 
    SCET (in ABSTRACT) year, day of year, month, date, time
    format; determined from corrected SCLK count; also converted into an
    equivalent SCET count of seconds since 1958
 
 
    Times in MAG label files
 
    START_TIME
    SCLK time of first record in data file; obtained from FIRST TIME in
    flatfile header
 
    STOP_TIME
    SCLK time of last record in data file; obtained from LAST TIME in
    flatfile header
 
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START_COUNT
    SCLK time of first record in data file; determined from SPICE utility
    CHRONOS using START_TIME; format p/ssss.ttt
 
    SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_STOP_COUNT
    SCLK time of last record in data file; determined from SPICE utility
    CHRONOS using STOP_TIME; format p/ssss.ttt
 
 
    SCLK (in NOTE)
    SCLK count obtained from tertiary header of CHDO file; also converted
    into year, day of year, month, date, time format; obtained from
    flatfile-header ABSTRACT; may differ from START_TIME by some minutes
 
    SCET (in NOTE)
    year, day of year, month, date, time format; determined from

  Preprocessing
  =============
    MAG data are raw data that have been preprocessed to extract them
    from the telemetry packets received from the spacecraft. This
    preprocessing converted raw voltages into magnetic-field
    measurements with engineering units (nT-like) and assigned
    individual times to each field measurement, the time of the first
    vector in a packet corresponds to the start time of the packet and
    the other vectors are calculated from that, for more information see
    the &apos;Confidence Level Overview&apos; in this file. Software that converts
    these data to calibrated nT and transforms them to different time
    and coordinate systems is included with this archive.  One exception
    to this is SHM data for which fully calibrated data are archived.
 
 
 
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The software required to calibrate and transform MAG data into
    alternative time and coordinate systems is provided as executable
    files for PC and as source code for compilation on other platforms.
 
    The packages are
 
    Cal02    -  calibrates vector data and transforms them from sensor
                coordinates to spacecraft coordinates, and,
    TransCal -  converts SCLK counts into International Atomic Time,
                transforms vector data from spacecraft coordinates
                into alternative coordinate systems, and appends
                spacecraft trajectory data to transformed data
                records.
 
    Following are examples of typical user input to these
    packages. User guides giving full descriptions of the implementation
    and operation of these software packages are contained in this
    archive they are called the &apos;Cassini MAG Data Processing Software:
    CAL02 User Guide&apos; and &apos;Cassini MAG Data Processing Software:
    TransCal User Guide&apos; both by Joyce Wolf of JPL.

  Ancillary data
  ==============
    Additional data that form part of this archive volume include
    magnetometer-calibration data in /CALIB and SPICE kernels in
    /GEOMETRY.  These data are used in calibrating the magnetic-
    field measurements and, if desired, transforming them into other
    coordinate systems.
 
 
    Data such as analog, command validation, configuration
    image, error counter and user-defined engineering data, are included
    in this archive for completeness and are not required for
    processing the magnetic-field data.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The magnetic-field data that comprise this archive are raw data
    derived directly from telemetry packets.  We believe that the
    accompanying calibration data provided for the FGM, VHM and SHM
    data sets is the best that we can achieve at this time.
 
    The FGM data contain persistent noise signals at 0.2, 8, 16
    Hz, and associated harmonics.  This noise was not observed during
    ground testing of the instruments and is anticipated to be
    interference arising from the spacecraft.  Removal of these signals
    is at the user&apos;s discretion.
 
    There is irregular timing in the data samples.  This is
    caused by the limited resolution of the msec counter in the time
    field. For example, there are 128 FGM vectors in each science
    packet, the time of the packet corresponds to the time of the first
    vector in the packet. Times are calculated for the other vectors
    using the known onboard vector sample rate and average exponent.
    These calculated times don&apos;t have the reduced resolution of the msec
    counter. Thus at the first vector of each packet there can be a
    small time jump due to the msec counter resolution. This time
    difference is maximum 8 msecs (not 4msecs which is the resolution
    of the counter) because the DPU software only generates even msec
    values due to internal truncation.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    -------------------------
    There are routine events that cause data quality problems so
    chronological listings of them have been included in this archive:
      -calibration activities superimpose calibration data on top of
       science data and are documented in SCAS_TIMES.ASC (for more
       information on calibration activies refer to &apos;THE CASSINI
       MAGNETIC FIELD INVESTIGATION&apos; by Dougherty et al in this archive)
      -data spikes may be seen at instrument range changes. Range
       changes are documented in RANGE_CHANGES.ASC
      -mode changes affect which sensors produce instrument data and
       spikes or rapid changes in data averaging may be seen at mode
       changes.  The first few packets after the instrument is unmuted
       or after Science Packets recommence can be highly or incorrectly
       averaged.  MODE_CHANGES.ASC lists the times of these events.
      -date corruption of the on-board memory (SSR) shown through spurious
       range changes lasting only one vector.  The times of these corrupted
       vectors are listed in SPURIOUS_RANGE_CHANGES.ASC
 
    Data gaps may be instrument related (e.g. a sensor turning
    on/off) or mission related (e.g. telemetry downlink problems). The
    former are documented in MODE_CHANGES.ASC. All mission related gaps
    are listed in GAP_FILEs - GAP_FILE_SCI_HK.ASC for science data in
    the housekeeping packets and in GAP_FILE_SCI_SD.ASC for science data
    in the science packets. Instrument related gaps of less than one day
    also show up in the GAP_FILES as well as in MODE_CHANGES.ASC
 
    Most of the information in the GAP_FILEs are extracted from
    packets received reports and so follow a fixed-width tabular format.
    Multi-day gaps are not documented in the source listings and have
    been added manually with a different format including an explanation
    of the gap - if a reason is known.  A summary of scientifically
    significant gaps is included below.
