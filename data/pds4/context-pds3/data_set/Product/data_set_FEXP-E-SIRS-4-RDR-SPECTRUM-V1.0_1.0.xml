    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The SIRIS measurement objectives were: 1) to measure
      reflectance spectra of a bright and dark target at each GRSFE
      site for potential use in AVIRIS calibration; 2) to fully
      characterize selected sites at the GRSFE modeling site (Lunar
      Lake, NV) using visible/infrared reflectance; 3) to collect
      reflectance spectra for selected endmember materials at each of
      the GRSFE sites; and 4) to make reflectance measurements for
      inter-instrument calibration.
 
      Visible/Infrared field spectral measurements using the SIRIS
      were made on 15-19 July.  The SIRIS was set up with
      standardized geometry; a nadir view from 75 cm above the ground
      surface, facing towards the sun.  Undisturbed surfaces were
      measured including rock outcrops, surface coatings where
      present, and soils.  All measurements were made using the HALON
      standard, which makes conversion to absolute reflectance based
      on NBS standard HALON possible.  This conversion was not
      routinely performed for the SIRIS data and all spectra provided
      for GRSFE are relative to HALON.  No additional SIRIS
      measurements were made for September AVIRIS flights.
 
      SIRIS spectra were reduced to reflectance using software
      provided by GER.  This procedure consists of simple division of
      the sample radiance spectrum by the reference radiance
      spectrum.  The GER grating-match adjustment was applied to
      correct for offsets at the grating boundaries and grating
      overlaps were removed by deleting overlap channels.  Previous
      experience with the instrument and inspection of raw data plots
      indicated that noisy channels between 1.32 - 1.42 micrometers
      and 1.78 - 1.95 micrometers should be deleted.  Deleted points
      were coded as 9.99999999.  Spectra for some measurement sites
      were discarded completely because of excess noise and other
      problems.
 
      Spectra were measured at Kelso Dunes on 15 July 1989 along the
      road and parking lot south of the sand dunes in the center of
      the valley.  These measurements were averaged to constitute the
      Bright Target.  The Dark Target measurement is the average of
      two spectra taken of the gravel at the power station along the
      main KelBaker road.  Spectra were measured at the Cima Volcanic
      Field on 15 July 1989 for basalt and basalt gravel and averaged
      as the Dark Target.  The average of two stream wash spectra
      constitute the Bright Target.
 
      Spectra were measured at Lunar Crater Volcanic Field
      periodically throughout the day of 17 July, 1989 for the playa,
      disturbed playa surface, and cobble modeling sites.  Spectra of
      a Dark Target (basalt gravel) and Bright Target (small playa
      surface) were measured on 19 July 1989 at Ubehebe Crater.
      Spectra of additional targets were not measured because of
      rapidly changing, cloudy, weather conditions.  Spectra of the
      Trail Canyon fan in Death Valley, the salt flat in the center
      of Devil&apos;s Golf Course adjacent to the fan, and sand dunes near
      Stovepipe Wells were measured on 18 July 1989.
 
      Measurements made with the SIRIS at the Lunar Lake modeling
      site for comparison of instrument response.  These measurements
      were made using the JPL SPECTRALON plate as a reference
      standard.

        2.5 micrometer range (Weidner and Hsia, 1981).

    Overview
    ========
      Several instrument artifacts (or atmospheric bands) are
      apparent in the SIRIS data.  First, there are small instrument
      glitches near 0.6, 0.76, 0.93, 1.06, and 1.49 micrometers.
      Secondly, there are commonly prominent CO2 absorption features
      near 2.005 and 2.05 micrometers that are probably caused by
      changing atmospheric conditions between measurement of the
      reference and the sample spectra.  Spectra measured with the
      SIRIS in the lab for the Lunar Lake materials do not show many
      of these features.
