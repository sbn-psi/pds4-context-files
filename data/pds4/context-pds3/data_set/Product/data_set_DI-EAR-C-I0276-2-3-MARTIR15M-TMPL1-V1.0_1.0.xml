            The presented dataset represents 4 half-nights of observing at
            San Pedro Martir, Baja, Mexico. The target, Comet 9P/Tempel 1,
            was impacted by the Deep Impact impactor on the third night of
            observing, 4 July UT. The observations are optical broadband
            imaging (BVRI filters), on a 1.5 m telescope, with a time
            resolution around 10 sec near impact and 20 sec at most other
            times.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
  This data set includes optical observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 in
  support of the Deep Impact mission. The data were taken at the San
  Pedro Martir telescope, in Baja, Mexico, 2-5 July UT 2005. The data
  were subsequently published by Knight et al. 2007 [KNIGHTETAL2007].
 
  The published light curve for this data set is being combined with
  that of the near-infrared data set collected on 2-9 July 2005 from
  KPNO (DI/EAR-C-SQIID-3-9PNIRIMAGES-V1.0) and is in preparation at
  the Small Bodies Node.
 
  Data
  =====
  Data included are the individual images taken, in a total of 4 filters;
  B, V, R, and, I. The targets of the observations were comet 9P/Tempel 1
  and one standard star field for calibration of photometry. The
  telescope used is the 1.5 meter telescope at San Pedro Martir, Baja,
  Mexico. The camera was a SITe 1K chip with 0.274&apos;/pixel, covering
  4.7x4.7 arcmin in total.
 
  Typically an excellent observing site, the seeing recorded for the
  observing run consistently was near 2 arcsecs. The first of the four
  nights, 2 July UT, was partly cloudy and was not photometric. The
  following three nights, July 3-5, were all photometric.
 
  A total of 1054 images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 are included in this
  data set, and 532 images of the calibration field PG1633.
 
  In the archived images, North is left and East is up.  The overscan was
  not trimmed in the reduced files.  Very few bad columns exist in the data,
  but those that persist throughout the data set are columns 531, 547, and
  980.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The first of the four nights, 2 July UT, was partly cloudy and was
    not photometric. The following three nights, July 3-5, were all
    photometric.  The data labels for the first night do not include
    airmass values, as they were not recorded into the FITS file header
    on this night of observing.
