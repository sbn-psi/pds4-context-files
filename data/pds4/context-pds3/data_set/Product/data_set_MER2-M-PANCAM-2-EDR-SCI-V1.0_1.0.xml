  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains raw Pancam science data. If 12 to 8 bit
    scaling was commanded, these images HAVE been transformed back to
    12 bits. Therefore, these images can be used for quantitative
    studies of the surface color and mineralogic properties, to
    constrain aerosol physical and radiative properties, and to asses
    the morphology, topography, and geologic context of each rover site.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    This documentation uses the Committee on Data Management and
    Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system. The MER Camera
    Payload EDRs referred to in this document are considered Level 2
    or Edited Data (equivalent to NASA Level 0). The EDRs are to be
    reconstructed from Level 1 or Raw Data, which are the telemetry
    packets within the project specific Standard Formatted Data Unit
    (SFDU) record. They are to be assembled into complete images, but
    will not be radiometrically or geometrically corrected.
 
    EDR data products will be generated by MIPL using the telemetry
    processing software mertelemproc at JPL. The EDRs produced will be
    raw uncalibrated data reconstructed from telemetry packet SFDUs
    and formatted according to this SIS. Meta-data acquired from the
    telemetry data headers and a meta-data database will be used to
    populate the PDS label. Missing packets will be identified and
    reported for retransmission to the ground as partial datasets.
    Prior to retransmission, the missing EDR data will be filled with
    zeros. The EDR data will be reprocessed only after all
    partial datasets are retransmitted and received on the ground. In
    these cases, the original EDR version will be overwritten.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    As the fundamental science image data archive product, the Science
    EDR will be generated by the Athena Pancam Science and Microscopic
    Imager Science Teams under SOAS at JPL to recover the original
    12-bit raw measurement obtained by the respective science camera to
    within the uncertainty of the noise in the original measured value.
    The size of a Science EDR data product is approximately 2 MB. The
    total estimated volume of Science EDRs over the course of the
    nominal 90-day MER mission is less than that of the Operations
    EDRs, and depends on the definition of the Science EDR archive set.
 
    The data packaged in the camera data files will be decoded,
    decompressed camera image data in single frame form as an Experiment
    Data Record (EDR). The Full Frame form of a standard image data file
    has the maximum dimensions of 1024 lines by 1024 samples.
 
    1) Full Frame EDR
       Full Frame EDRs are stored as 16-bit signed integers. If 12-to-8
       bit scaling is performed, then pixels are stored in 16-bit format
       and only the last 8 bits of the 16-bit integer are used.
 
    2) Thumbnail EDR
       Thumbnail EDRs are stored as 16-bit signed integers or 8-bit
       unsigned integers. If 12-to-8 bit scaling is performed, then
       pixels are stored in 16-bit format and only the last 8 bits of
       the 16- bit integer are used. The Thumbnail EDR is a sized down
       version of the original acquired image (i.e., camera returned
       pixel data), and size of the binary EDR image data is variable.
       However, the original acquired image is not always downlinked.
       The main purpose of a Thumbnail EDR is to provide an image
       summary using a very low data volume compared to the original
       image.
 
    3) Sub-frame EDR
       Sub-frame EDRs are a subset of rows and columns of the
       1024 x 1024 full frame image. Sub-frame EDRs are stored as 16-bit
       signed integers. If 12-to-8 bit scaling is performed, then pixels
       are stored in 16-bit format and only the last 8 bits of the
       16-bit integer are used.
 
    4) Downsampled EDR
       A downsampled EDR is a smaller version of the 1024 x 1024 full
       frame or subframed image using the following methods: 1) nearest
       neighbor pixel averaging, 2) pixel averaging with outlier
       rejection or 3) computing the median pixel value. Downsampled
       EDRs are stored as 16-bit signed integers. If 12-to-8 bit scaling
       is performed, then pixels are stored in 16-bit format and only
       the last 8 bits of the 16-bit integer are used.
 
    5) Reference Pixels
       The onboard CCD array has 16 pre-Reference dark pixels
       (12-bits) located at the beginning and 15 post-Reference dark
       pixels (12-bits) located at the end of each row. The values of
       these pixels indicate the bias level of the camera at the time of
       each observation. The Reference Pixel images were losslessly
       compressed for downlink. For complex design reasons, the last
       post-Reference pixel is a copy of the next-to-last
       post-Reference pixel. Following the last post-Reference
       dark pixel, at the very end of each row, is the camera hardware
       serial number (left-shifted by 4 bits if 12-bit data).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    MER Camera Payload downlink processing software is focused on rapid
    reduction, calibration, and visualization of images in order to make
    discoveries, to accurately and expeditiously characterize the
    geologic environment around the rover, and to provide timely input
    for operational decisions concerning rover navigation and Instrument
    Deployment Device (IDD) target selection. Key software tools have
    been developed at Cornell University, at JPL by the MIPL, SSV, and
    APSS groups, at NASA Ames, and at the USGS/Flagstaff. These tools
    can also be used to process MI images (see below), as well as Navcam
    and Hazcam images, which have substantial scientific potential in
    addition to their operational importance
 
    PDS-labeled images and tables can be viewed with the program
    NASAView, developed by the PDS and available for a variety of
    computer platforms from the PDS web site
    http://pdsproto.jpl.nasa.gov/Distribution/license.html.
    There is no charge for NASAView.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    The data set will initally be delivered and kept online. Upon Mission
    completion, the Pancam EDRs will be delivered to PDS on DVD.
