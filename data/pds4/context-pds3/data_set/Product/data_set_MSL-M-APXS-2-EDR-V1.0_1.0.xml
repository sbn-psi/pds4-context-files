    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Alpha-Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) is a contact
      instrument that uses X-ray spectroscopy to determine the
      elemental composition of soils and rocks. Atmosphere argon can
      also be measured by the APXS. The APXS is deployed on
      selected targets along the rover traverse to determine the
      elemental composition of samples. Materials processed by the
      Sample Acquisition - Sample Processing and Handling (SA/SPaH)
      system can also be delivered to the observation tray or to the
      martian surface for analysis by APXS. Elements heavier than Na
      can be detected by APXS. If present at sufficient levels, the
      abundances of these elements can also be determined.
 
      The instrument consists of a sensor head mounted on the
      rover&apos;s Robotic Arm (RA) component of the MSL SA-SPaH tools
      suite, and electronics mounted in the Rover Chassis. The APXS
      has access to an onboard calibration targets for post-landing
      calibration. The MSL APXS includes a Peltier cooler for the
      detector chip that can be activated to achieve better
      performance at daytime ambient temperatures. A total
      observation time of 2 to 3 hours is necessary for a full
      analysis; however, it is also possible to perform a quick
      analysis in about 15 minutes. For those familiar with the Mars
      Exploration rover (MER) APXS, these MSL observations times are
      shorter due to the different source-detector geometry. Other
      significant differences from MER include the cooler which
      expands daytime operations, and the need to transfer data to
      the rover computer prior to instrument power down (no memory
      backup). Similar to operations on MER, the rover may go to
      sleep to conserve energy once the APXS acquisition has
      started; however, the rover must be awake to stop the
      observation and retrieve the data.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      APXS EDR data products are considered CODMAC Level 2 or Edited
      Data (equivalent to NASA level 0) products. The EDR data files
      are generated from Level 1 or Raw Data, which are the
      telemetry packets within the project specific Standard
      Formatted Data Unit (SFDU) record.
 
      The APXS EDR data products will be generated by the MIPL
      (Multimission Image Processing Laboratory) at JPL under the
      Operations Product Generation System (OPGS). The
      EDR data products will be raw uncalibrated data reconstructed
      from telemetry data products in the format described by the
      APXS EDR SIS. Meta-data collected when the rover prepared the
      science data for downlink will be provided in PDS label.
 
      There will be multiple versions of an APXS EDR. If telemetry
      data is missing during the initial downlink from the rover
      memory, partial data sets will be created and the missing data
      will be filled with zeroes. The data will be reprocessed after
      all data are received and the original version will be
      overwritten. There can be up to 2 EDRs created, one with a
      status of partial and the other with a complete status in the
      filename.
 
    Data
    ====
      Each APXS EDR will consist of two files. The first file is an
      ASCII formatted detached PDS label. The second file is a
      binary data file. The APXS EDR data file is a copy of what was
      in the APXS memory buffer. That is, the EDR consists of
      unprocessed experiment data stored in binary format along with
      additional Rover FSW meta-data. The instrument holds data for the
      thirteen most recent measurements in memory. When a new measurement
      begins, the oldest one is discarded. Each spectrum has a unique
      identifier. There is also a data block containing instrument
      engineering data.
 
      There are 2 types of APXS EDRs: the APXS Science EDR and the
      APXS CWA (Current Working Area) EDR. The science EDR contains
      all 13 measurements and the engineering data. The CWA EDR only
      contains the most recent measurement.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The data presented in the APXS EDR is intended to be the least
      processed, most primitive data set released for APXS. Data
      presented here are an accurate representation of APXS data as
      received from the rover.
 
    Review
    ======
      The APXS EDR products are reviewed internally by the APXS team
      prior to release to the PDS. PDS also performs an external peer
      review of the APXS EDR.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
     Data reported are the minimally processed data received from
     the orbiter during nominal APXS operations. All data received
     is reformatted into the EDR data. Data are by
     definition of good quality, as damaged telemetry packets are
     sequestered upon receipt from the spacecraft. We do not expect
     to receive many (if any) damaged data packets.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      The major limitation of this data set is that this is level 0,
      minimally processed data. The data are received from the
      spacecraft telemetry and ingested into a database. If gaps
      exist in the telemetry, data are lost.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
      No data compression is used.
