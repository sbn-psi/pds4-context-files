  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The data set consists of ground-based images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 in the R
    and HB filters taken at the Kitt Peak Mayall 4m telescope from July 2-9,
    2005 around the Deep Impact encounter.
    The Kitt Peak Mayall 4m telescope with the MOSAIC camera at Prime focus
    was used for all observations. Harris broad-band filters optimized for the
    Landolt broad-band colors were used, as well as narrowband HB filters. The
    comet was tracked at non-sidereal rates.
    However, occasionally, the tracking failed and some comet images are
    smeared.
 
    Raw, as well as reduced images are included. Corresponding calibration
    frames (dome flats and bias frames) are included. All the data were bias
    subtracted, flat fielded, corrected for crosstalk, and the pupil
    contamination was removed when necessary following the data reduction
    guide by Buell Jannuzi, Jenna Claver, and Frank Valdes, available at
    http://www.noao.edu/noao/noaodeep/ReductionOpt/frames.html
 
    As the MOSAIC camera has been replaced since our observations, the
    relevant manual has been included in this archive for reference.
    Note that the MOSIAC camera consists of 8 CCDs arranged in a 4x2 pattern.
    The corresponding raw fits files have therefore 8 extensions (from 1 to
    8). As the comet did not cover the entire MOSAIC field, it was always
    placed on the same chip (#2). The reduced data were therefore trimmed to a
    much smaller size. The corresponding fits files do not contain extensions.
 
    Note that sometimes (but rarely) there are no corresponding reduced images
    due to e.g. tracking errors, filters not used for Temepl 1, or the objects
    not being placed in chip #2).
 
    Landolt standard fields are available in photometric nights.
 
    The observing logs, as well as additional hand-written logs are included
    in the archive, although some logs are incomplete.
 
    Tables listing the centers (x,y) of the Landolt standard stars in the
    reduced images are also included. NOTE that the origin is (1,1). The
    centers for the HB standard stars are not included as they are always the
    brightest object in the image and easy to identify. The centers for comet
    9P/Tempel 1 are also not given, as it is always the brightest extended
    object in the image and easy to identify.
 
    For the photometric nights, tables relating the counts of individual
    images to calibrated flux units for the broadband R as well as the HB
    comet filters are also included.
 
      f(X) = counts/sec * f0(X) * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP(X)-coeff(X)*airmass))
 
    where m0=25mag is the zero point offset of the magnitude scale, ZP(X) the
    zero point, coeff(X) the airmass coefficient, and counts/sec is the DN
    value read from the image / exposure time.
 
    Therefore
 
      f(X) = DN value * f0(X) * conversion factor
 
    where the conversion factor is
 
       1/exptime * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP(X)-coeff(X)*airmass))
 
    These conversion factors are given in tables.
    For the broadband R filter, X=R and f0(R)=2.23E-09 erg s^-1 cm^-2
    Angstrom^-1 (converted from Bessel 1979). The error in f0(R) is 0.02E-09
    due to the difference in effective wavelength between the Cousins Filter
    and the Harris filter. The filter response curves however look very
    similar to each other.
 
    For the narrowband HB filters, the values for f0(X) in
    10E-9 erg s^-1 cm^-2 Angstrom^-1 (Farnham et al. 2000) are:
      f0(OH)=10.560
      f0(CN)=8.6
      f0(C2)=3.887
      f0(UC)=7.802
      f0(BC)=6.210
      f0(GC)=3.616
      f0(RC)=1.316
 
 
    The archiving of this data set was supported by NASA&apos;s Planetary Mission
    Data Analysis Program.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The errors in the conversion factors given in the tables for 9P/Tempel 1
    are about 2%.
 
    The comet was tracked non-sidereally. However, sometimes the tracking
    failed, and some comet images are trailed.
