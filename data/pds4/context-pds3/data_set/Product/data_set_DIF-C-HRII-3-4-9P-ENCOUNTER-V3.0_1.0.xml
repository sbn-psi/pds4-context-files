  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains calibrated, 1.05- to 4.8-micron spectral images
    of comet 9P/Tempel 1 the acquired by the High Resolution Infrared
    Spectrometer (HRII) from 20 June through 06 July 2005 during the
    encounter phase of the Deep Impact mission.
 
    Version 3.0 was calibrated by the EPOXI mission pipeline and includes
    the correct interpretation of microsecond counter of the spacecraft
    clocks that previously introduced maximum errors of about 40
    milliseconds in the earlier observation times, a corrected IR absolute
    spectral calibration step that previously inflated all spectra by a
    factor of 2, and an upgrade to the ALTFF line-dependent integration
    time. Version 3.0 also includes a new flat-field file derived from
    EPOXI lunar calibrations, improved quadrant-averaged linearity
    coefficients, and a refinement in the absolute spectral calibration
    curve. For Version 3.0, the EPOXI convention for constructing
    PRODUCT_IDs and data file names was used. For more information see
    the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document in this dataset and
    Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].

  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial/along-slit) FITS
    spectral images and PDS labels in this dataset were generated in late
    2013 by the EPOXI data pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s Science
    Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  Known limitations and
    deficiencies of the pipeline and the resulting data are discussed in
    the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document in this dataset and by
    Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011] and in &apos;Deep Impact Instrument
    Calibration&apos; by Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
    For HRII spectra, the pipeline generates two types of calibrated
    products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be reversible
        because the calibration steps can be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be irreversible because
        the calibration steps, such as smoothing over bad pixels, cannot
        easily be backed out to return to the original, raw data
        numbers.
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes, in the
    order listed, on the raw HRII FITS data to produce the RADREV and
    RAD products found in this data set (the process uses the image
    mode to select the appropriate set of calibration files):
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS header
      - Quadrant-averaged linearization of raw data numbers
      - Subtraction of dark noise, derived using quadrant-averaged
        linearization of either in scene dark frames, specific
        exposure-ID darks, or optimized mode- dependent master dark
        frames (the prisms/spectral imaging module and IR focal plane
        array temperatures, OPTBENT and IRFPAT in the FITS header, are
        used for scaling if dark modeling is required)
      - Division by a flat field, derived from quadrant-averaged
        linearization
      - Determine spectral registration and bandwidth for each pixel
        (using OPTBENT from FITS headers)
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV) and that was
        derived from quadrant-based linearization
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust.
      - Set non-image pixels at the left, right, and bottom edges to zero in
        the RADREV and RAD products.  The &apos;real data&apos; window of an image
        is given by CALWINDW in the FITS header.  If edge pixels need to be
        analyzed, the original DN values can be found in the raw products
        located in the PDS dataset, DIF-C-HRII-2-9P-ENCOUNTER-V1.0.
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the per-pixel
    image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps derived for per-pixel linearity (missing pixels were
        identified when the raw FITS files were created).
 
    The pipeline also created FITS image extensions for a spectral
    registration (wavelength) map, a spectral resolution (bandwidth) map,
    and a signal-to-noise ratio map, which are briefly described in the
    next section.  The calibration steps and files applied to each raw
    image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS
    data label.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated spectral image is stored as FITS.  The primary
      data unit contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the
      fastest varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from
      about 1.05 to 4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding
      to the spatial or along-slit dimension.  The primary image is
      followed by four image extensions that are two-dimensional
      pixel-by-pixel maps providing additional information about the
      spectral image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte consisting of eight,
          single-bit flags to describe the quality of each pixel
          in the primary image.  The PDS data label defines the
          purpose of each single-bit flag.
 
        - The second extension provides the spectral registration or
          wavelength for each pixel in the primary image.  This
          extension is required because the wavelength for each
          pixel changes as the temperature of the instrument
          increased or decreased.
 
        - The third extension provides the spectral bandwidth for
          each pixel in the primary image.  This extension is
          required because the bandwidth for each pixel changes as
          the temperature of the instrument increased or decreased.
 
        - The fourth extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a data label and provides more information about the FITS primary
      image and the extensions.  Many values in a data label were
      extracted from FITS image header keywords which are defined in the
      document EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files is
      HIyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;HI&apos; identifies the HRII
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Spectral scans often had 32 or more frames for one
      specific exposure.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 50
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 9000028, the
      first FITS file name would be HI05070404_9000028_001_RR.FIT and the
      last would be HI05070404_9000028_050_RR.FIT.
 
      This convention is the one used by the EPOXI pipeline to construct
      data product file names and PRODUCT_IDs.  To translate between the
      EPOXI and Deep Impact conventions, refer to the
      HRII_TRANSLATE_PRODUCT_ID.LBL and HRII_TRANSLATE_PRODUCT_ID.TAB
      files located in the DOCUMENT directory of this dataset.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All calibrated data products are uncompressed.  If an associated
      raw data product was compressed on board the flyby spacecraft (and
      thus received on the ground and archived as compressed) then the
      calibration pipeline used one of four 8-bit lookup tables to
      decompress the raw image.  For more information, see the EPOXI
      Calibration Pipeline Summary document as well as Hampton, et al.
      (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005], Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006]
      and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when it is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      Using this convention to display an approach image of Tempel 1,
      ecliptic North is toward the right and the Sun is down.  After
      impact, the Flyby spacecraft came out of shield mode and turned
      back to observe at the comet.  For lookback images, ecliptic
      North is toward the left and the Sun is down.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation of HRII flight images with those
      from ground-based calibrations as well as those from the Medium
      Resolution Instrument CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument
      CCD (HRIV) CCD (ITS), see the quadrant nomenclature section in
      Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006] and Klaasen, et al. (2013)
      [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
    Spectral Scans
    --------------
      Each HRII scan of Tempel consists of multiple frames within one
      exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in the data labels).  To work with these
      spectral scans, it is recommended that all frames for one exposure
      ID be stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a
      spatial-spatial map can be produced for a specific wavelength by
      selecting the appropriate spectral column from the image cube.
      Spectral wavelengths are provided by the second FITS extension, the
      spectral registration (wavelength) map.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      For a comparison of the relative locations of the IR slit with
      respect to the fields of view of the Medium Resolution Instrument
      CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument CCD (HRI), see the
      instrument alignment section of Klaasen, et al. (2008)
      [KLAASENETAL2006].  To visually inspect where the IR slit was
      estimated to be on the nucleus of Tempel 1 during impact and
      lookback, see the HRII/HRIV context maps included Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    Timing for Spectra
    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction is
      vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out from the
      left and right edges and toward the center and starting with the
      first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at the top of
      the display.  Since the detector is reset and read out on a
      pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at which
      each pixel is exposed although each pixel has the same exposure
      duration -- except for the ALTFF mode that has different read and
      reset causing the effective exposure time to vary with line number,
      i.e., along the slit in the spatial direction.  Additionally, the end
      of the spectrometer slit that always points roughly towards the sun
      is the first line to be readout and the last line to be read out is
      furthest from the sun, assuming the spacecraft is in its usual
      orientation with the solar panels pointing roughly toward the sun.
      For more information about the timing of the spectra, see the zero
      exposure background section of the EPOXI instrument calibration paper
      by Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].  A brief discussion
      about how the calibration pipeline handles the ALTFF mode is included
      in the EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      The calibrated RADREV and RAD image data have units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      A summary of the imaging modes is provided here. For more information
      see Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005], Klaasen, et al. (2008)
      [KLAASENETAL2006] and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].  In
      the table below, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is the
      spatial dimension along the slit.
 
                    X-Size  Y-Size  Bin
        Mode Name   (pix)   (pix)  Type  Comments
        ---- ------ ------  -----  ----- ------------------------------------
          1  BINFF    512     256   2x2  Binned full frame
          2  BINSF1   512     126   2x2  Binned sub-frame
          3  BINSF2   512      64   2x2  Binned sub-frame
          4  UBFF    1024     512   1x1  Unbinned full frame
          5  ALTFF    512     256   2x2  Alternate mode 1 (min. exposure
                                         time is 1/2 of mode 1)
          6  DIAG    1024     512   1x1  Diagnostic, one reset frame followed
                                         by a separate read frame such that
                                         odd IMAGE_NUMBERs are reset frames
                                         and even IMAGE_NUMBERs are read
                                         frames
          7  MEMCK   1024     512   1x1  Memory Check
 
      By utilizing the different imaging modes of the HRII instrument, the
      observational requirements for desired exposure times were met.
      Note, of the 7 modes, only modes 1-6 were used for the encounter with
      comet Hartley 2.  Subframe modes are binned (2x2), reduce the spatial
      (LINE) extent of the image FOV, and have a shorter readout time which
      reduces the exposure time for bright objects and keeps the detector
      from saturating.
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The timing and geometric parameters included in the data labels and
    FITS headers were computed using the final version of the kernel
    files archived in the Deep Impact SPICE dataset DI-C-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this dataset were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset was peer reviewed and certified for scientific use on
    21 March 2014.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this dataset.
 
    Transient anomalous pixels may be present in the data.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second uncertainty between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations and an uncertainty of about one half of a
      second between the clocks on the flyby and impactor spacecraft.
      These improved kernels were included in the DI SPICE data set
      and were used to calculate the geometric parameters in the PDS
      data labels.  For more information about this discrepancy, see
      the Deep Impact Spacecraft Clock Correlation report,
      SCLK_CORRELATION.ASC, provided on the Deep Impact and EPOXI
      documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
      The EPOXI project plans to generate a complete and highly accurate
      set of UTC correlations since launch.  This will ultimately result
      in a future version of a SCLK that will retroactively change
      correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI data.  When this
      kernel is available, it will be added to the SPICE data sets for
      the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE web site at
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in 2005
      indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus
      problem does not significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more
      details please see the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels are included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the EPOXI:MINIMUM and EPOXI:MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the reference rows and columns
      located at the edges of the image.  For more information, see the
      quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
