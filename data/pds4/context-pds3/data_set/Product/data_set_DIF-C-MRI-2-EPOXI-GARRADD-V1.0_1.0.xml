  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains raw clear-filter, C2, CN, OH and dust
    continuum images of comet C/Garradd (2009 P1) acquired by the Medium
    Resolution Visible CCD (MRI) from 20 February through 09 April 2012
    during the Cruise 3 phase of the EPOXI mission.
 
    While DI Flyby spacecraft (DIF) was officially in hibernation after the
    encounter with comet 103P/Hartley 2 in November 2010, it continued to
    carry out observations of comets from a distance as the opportunity
    arises.  One such observing program was carried out in 2012 on comet
    C/Garradd (2009 P1).  Observations were obtained with the MRI CCD and
    the High Resolution Visible CCD (HRIV, archived separately) during a
    series of windows from 20 February through 09 April 2012 as the comet
    receded from 1.74 AU to 2.11 AU from the Sun and at a distance of
    1.88 AU to 1.30 AU from the spacecraft.
 
    Hourly sequences were obtained between 20 February and 07 March and
    again between 06-09 April with a few gaps for spacecraft maneuvers and
    data downloads.  During these windows, HRIV sequences consisted of a
    single Clear image, while each MRI sequence consisted of 13 broad- and
    narrowband images:  3 Clear, 3 CN, 2 C2, 2 OH and 2 Green Continuum.
    Images were unbinned 256x256-pixel subframe sections with the comet
    near the center of the frame.
 
    Modified visible imaging sequences were interspersed with the 1.05- to
    4.8-micron infrared spectral imaging scans (archived separately)
    obtained March 26-27 and April 2-3.  During these windows, 3 HRIV Clear
    images were obtained every hour, while the MRI sequences consisted of 1
    Clear and 1 CN image sampled every 15 minutes.
 
    Initial results based on the visible-wavelength imaging are presented
    in Farnham, et al. (2014) [FARNHAMETAL2014].  See the &apos;Related Data
    Sets&apos; section below for a list of separately archived visible- and
    infrared-wavelength data.
 
    In the course of the observations of comet Garradd, a massive solar
    coronal ejection event occurred on 06 March 2012.  The effects of this
    event were seen in the data obtained on 07 March, with cosmic rays
    rapidly increasing until they eventually overwhelmed the detector.
    This was the last day of the collection period, so the images had
    returned to normal by the next collection period on 25 March 2012.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and the
    image quality map are described in the EPOXI SIS document.  The SDC
    did not apply any type of correction or decompression algorithm to the
    raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte consisting of eight, single-bit flags to
      indicate the quality of each pixel in the primary image.  The data
      label provides a short description of each single-bit flag.  For
      more information about the FITS primary image and its extension or
      for examples of how to access and use the quality flags, refer to
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a data label and provides more information about the FITS primary
      image and the extensions.  Many values in a data label were
      extracted from FITS image header keywords which are defined in the
      document EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      MVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;MV&apos; identifies the MRI
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 6
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 4010000, the
      first FITS file name would be MV12022019_4010000_001.FIT and the
      last would be MV12022019_4010000_006.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All data products in this dataset are uncompressed.  Specifically
      all raw CCD images were never compressed on board the spacecraft.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when it is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of MRI to the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the instrument alignment section of the EPOXI SIS
      document or Klaasen, et al. (2011) [KLAASENETAL2011].

    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
      Since the pole of comet Garradd is not well known, the pipeline
      used the default SPICE kernel, GARRADD_0001.TPC, which specifies
      a non-rotating body with the positive pole aligned with EMEJ2000.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The timing and geometric parameters included in the data labels and
    FITS headers were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at
    the time the data products were generated.  Most kernels are available
    in the EPOXI SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0; others that had
    not yet been archived in the PDS when this dataset was produced are
    available online at the Operational Flight Project Kernels website
    maintained by the NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility
    (NAIF), http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data_operational.html.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this dataset were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset was peer reviewed and certified for scientific use on
    21 March 2014.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this dataset.
 
    Any horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.
    The image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.
    If the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map
    is turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.
    For more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The EPOXI project plans to generate a complete and highly accurate
      set of UTC correlations since launch.  This will ultimately result
      in a future version of a SCLK kernel that will retroactively change
      correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI data.  When this
      kernel is available, it will be added to the SPICE datasets for
      the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE web site at
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
   CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the MRI CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are 1/6 of a pixel
      smaller vertically than a normal row.  Therefore, reconstructed
      images, which have uniform row spacing, have a 1/3-pixel extension
      introduced at the center of the array.  Thus for two features on
      either side of the midpoint line, the vertical component of the
      actual angular separation between those features is one-third of a
      pixel less than their measured difference in vertical pixels in the
      image.  As for all geometric distortions, correction of this
      distortion will require resampling of the image and an attendant
      loss in spatial resolution.  The standard pipeline process does
      not perform this correction so as to preserve the best spatial
      resolution.
 
      The two 1/6-pixel narrower central rows collect only 5/6 of the
      charge of a normal row.  This effect is corrected by the flat-field
      division for calibrated science images so that the pixels in these
      rows have the correct scene radiance assigned to them.  However,
      point-source or disk-integrated photometric measurements using
      aperture photometry areas that include these central rows will be
      slightly distorted unless special adjustments are made.  For
      example, the aperture photometry process for comet 9P/Tempel 1 added
      an extra 1/6-pixel worth of signal to the to the pixels in each of
      these two rows in the reconstructed, calibrated images as described
      in Appendix A of Belton, et al., (2011) [BELTONETAL2011].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the EPOXI:DERIVED_MINIMUM and
      EPOXI:DERIVED_MAXIMUM keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and
      MAXPVAL in the FITS header) be used to scale an image for display
      because these values exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock
      rows and columns located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more
      information, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS
      document.
