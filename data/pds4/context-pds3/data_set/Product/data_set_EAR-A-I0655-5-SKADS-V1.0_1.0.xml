  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Sub-Kilometer Asteroid Diameter Survey (SKADS) (Gladman et al. 2009)
    acquired good-quality orbital and absolute magnitude (H) determinations
    for 1087 small main-belt asteroids in order to study the orbital and size
    distribution beyond H = 15, down to sub-kilometer sizes (H &gt; 18). This
    data set contains the astrometry, photometry, and orbits of the 1087
    asteroids detected by SKADS which have one-week time baselines or more.
 
    The detected asteroids range from H(R) = 12 - 22 and provide a set of
    objects down to sizes below 1 kilometer in diameter. We find an on-sky
    surface density of 210 asteroids per square degree in the ecliptic with
    opposition magnitudes brighter than m(R) = 23, with the cumulative number
    of asteroids increasing by a factor of 10^0.27/mag from m(R) = 18 down to
    the m(R) ~ 23.5 limit of our survey. In terms of absolute H magnitudes, we
    find that beyond H = 15 the belt exhibits a constant power-law slope with
    the number increasing proportional to 10^0.30H from H ~ 15-18, after which
    incompleteness begins in the survey.
 
    Observations
    ============
 
    Six nights were allocated for the SKADS program at the 3.8-m Mayall
    telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory: March 21, 22, and 23 UT 2001
    at the beginning of the dark run, and March 29, 30, and 31 UT at the end
    of the dark run. An asteroid detected in at least one night in both blocks
    would thus have an observed arc length of between 6 and 10 days if
    multiple observations could be successfully linked. The KPNO mosaic CCD
    camera gives a 36x36 arcminute field of view on the Mayall. We created a
    grid of contiguous sky coverage along the ecliptic plane  that was within
    a few degrees of the opposition point on the first night, covering 8.4
    square degrees of sky (which accounts for gaps between the mosaic&apos;s CCDs).
    The fields were translated 13.5 and 5.4 arcmin to the west and north
    (respectively) per day to keep as many main-belt asteroids as possible in
    the imaged region. These translation rates were determined using the
    average rates of known main-belt asteroids within a few degrees of the
    initial pointings.
 
    Filter choice was governed by a balance between obtaining maximum
    magnitude depth (discovering as many objects as possible) and the desire
    to acquire some color information on the asteroids.  Obtaining V-R colors
    allows us to estimate (even if only on a probabilistic basis) the
    taxonomic type of each detected asteroid. On photometric nights we thus
    acquired triplets of 120-sec images for object detection in R-band with an
    inter-exposure spacing of roughly 15 minutes.
 
    Immediately before or after one of these three R-band exposures on any
    given night, we acquired a 120-sec V-band exposure; the temporal proximity
    minimizes any possible light curve variations in the color measurement.
 
    Photometric and Astrometric Calibration
    =======================================
 
    On each night, Landolt standard fields were acquired at multiple
    airmasses.  Using this data, the standard 1 ADU/sec zeropoint and the
    airmass correction term in both V and R were measured. When conditions
    were taken in photometric conditions, aperture correction photometry was
    used to produce R-band and V-band magnitudes (corrected to airmass=1.0)
    for each asteroid image, with photometric uncertainties provided by
    DAOPHOT.
 
    When the wide &apos;VR&apos; filter was used in either above-median seeing or
    non-photometric conditions, a transformation from VR instrumental
    magnitudes to R-band magnitudes was estimated; the provided R-band
    measures thus have a unmeasured colour-dependent term and may be in
    non-photometric conditions.  Such measurements are flagged by having no
    uncertainty given for the R-band magnitude estimate and these photometric
    data are just &apos;sanity checks&apos;, with expected errors on the level of
    0.3-0.5 mags, and should not be used to draw scientific conclusions.
 
    The astrometric reference frame is based on the USNO-A2.0 catalog
    (J2000.0).
 
    Object Identification
    =====================
 
    Individual detections are identified by an internal identifier of the form
    pXXXYYN where XXX is the pointing number, YY is the chip number (1-8) of
    the Mosaic Camera, and N is a character in the range (1-9, a-h) indicating
    the specific detection within an image.  The first digit of the pointing
    number XXX indicates the night (1-6), and the pointing centers are listed
    by pointing number in the file pointings.tab.
 
    Detections linked (identified with a single orbit) across at least three
    nights and over both blocks of the run are assigned an object identifier
    which is the detection identifier of the first detection, but with the
    prefix changed to s: sXXXYYN.
 
    Astrometry for all detections were submitted to the Minor Planet Center
    and either identified with known asteroids or assigned provisional
    designations.  The cross-identification between internal SKADS
    designations and MPC asteroid numbers and provisional designations is
    given in the file mpcids.tab.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Judged by known asteroids in the field the typical uncertainties in the
    SKADS orbital elements (a/e/i) are less than 0.03AU/0.03/0.5deg. The
    distances to the objects are sufficiently well known that photometric
    uncertainties (of 0.3 magnitudes or better) dominate the error budget of
    their derived H-magnitudes.  See Gladman et al. (2009) for a detailed
    discussion of the uncertainties.
 
    Considerable effort was expended to understand differences between our
    results and other published works, particularly as to the effect of  the
    detection efficiency, measured or assumed, on the resulting absolute
    magnitude distribution.  The results from this investigation, as well as a
    discussion of the is described in detail in Section 9.1 of Gladman et al.
    (2009).
 
    In general, the uncertainties reported in this paper represent the authors
    best efforts to accurately describe the quality of both the data and the
    derived products, e.g. orbits and absolute magnitude distributions.
