  Data Set Overview
  =================
 
  This data set is intended to include all reported timings of observed
  asteroid, planet, and planetary satellite occultation events, as well as
  axes derived from those timings by David W. Dunham and David Herald.  Most
  of these timings are unpublished and have been collected by Dunham and
  Herald.  This version is complete through the end of 2009.
 
  The sizes (major and minor axes) derived from the occultation timing data
  are the result of an analysis program by Dunham and Herald, applied
  consistently to all the occultation events.
 
 
  Occultations Analysis Program
  =============================
 
  As input to the analysis, observers submit a report to the program
  including disappearance and reappearance timings, observatory
  location, and observing conditions.  The observations are reduced using the
  Besselian fundamental plane as the reference plane. The basic methodology is
  as follows.
 
   - The position of the asteroid is computed at three intervals, centered on
  the nominal mid time of the observed occultation. The positions are
  converted to (x,y) coordinates on the fundamental plane, expressed as a
  quadratic expression. These calculations are performed in the J2000
  reference frame.
 
   - The (x,y) position of each observer on the fundamental plane is computed
  at each of their event times. The orientation of the fundamental plane is
  referenced to the apparent equinox of date for this purpose.
 
   - All of the observer positions are referenced to a moving reference frame
  that is fixed relative to the asteroid. This reference frame has a nominal
  zero defined by the observer coordinates associated with the first
  observation. The motion of the reference frame is that of the asteroid.
 
   - The fit of an ellipse to the observations occurs in this moving reference
  frame (which is fixed relative to the asteroid). The calculations are
  performed in units of earth radii, and converted to km for output purposes.
 
   - The astrometric position of the asteroid is obtained by combining the
  motion of the moving reference frame with the location of the fitted ellipse
  on that reference frame, to obtain the time when the asteroid was closest to
  the geocenter - from which the time, separation and position angle of the
  asteroid relative to the star are derived.
 
  This methodology takes full account of the motions of the asteroid and the
  observers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
  The asteroid occultation timing data are collected into two files. The
  occlist file lists a total of 1662 occultations, one occultation per line,
  along with the identification of the asteroid and star, and additional
  information about the star including RA and dec.  These lines also include
  the major and minor axes derived from the timings for that occultation, if
  any, along with information about the analysis.  The list is chronological,
  with an occultation ID assigned to each one.  The occtimings file lists the
  individual timings measured for each occultation, with one disappearance and
  reappearance per line, as well as information about the observing site and
  the observational circumstances.  The latitude, longitude, and elevation of
  each site are included.
 
  Two analogous files, occsatlist and occsattime, with occultation data on
  planets and planetary satellites, are also included.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
 
  Summary files, occsummary.tab and occsatsummary.tab, contain the major and
  minor axes and position angles from the elliptical or circular fits,
  extracted from occlist and occsatlist respectively.
 
  Graphics image files show plots of the occultation fits for many of the
  occultations.  These image files are located in the document directory, and
  are accompanied by a descriptive text file 0Graphics.asc explaining how the
  plots are to be read.  The filenames of the image files concatenate the
  asteroid number, asteroid name or provisional designation, and occultation
  date.
 
 
  Modification History
  ====================
 
  The first version of this data set, introduced in 2003, included
  occultations only through 1998.  The update of 2004 not only adds
  occultations through March 1, 2004, but also provides a more systematic
  arrangement of the data.  The data set was again updated in 2005, 2006,
  2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.  The number of occultations included in each
  successive version is as follows:
 
     Year:   Version:  Number of occultations:
      2003    V1.0      183
      2004    V2.0      524
      2005    V3.0      680
      2006    V4.0      865
      2007    V5.0     1055
      2008    V6.0     1203
      2009    V7.0     1417
      2010    V8.0     1662

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set is compiled from the observations made by a large number of
    observers.  Indications to the confidence level of each observation are
    included in the data files.
