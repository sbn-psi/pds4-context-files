    Data Set Overview
    =================
      As part of GRSFE the directional variations in thermal emission
      of different surfaces were investigated.  Results were obtained
      using hand-held thermistor probes (to determine local kinetic
      temperature) and a ground-based, hand-held infrared radiometer
      (to determine scene-averaged infrared brightness temperature
      from multiple view angles).
 
      Field work took place in the Lunar Crater Volcanic Field.
      Three natural sites were selected, and four artificial sites
      were constructed.  The natural sites included: (1) Dry playa.
      The selected site was relatively smooth and flat, with a very
      small number of interbedded rocks less than 0.5 cm in size.
      Although a number of desiccation cracks were present, they
      occupied a small fraction of the radiometer field of view;
      observations at multiple viewing angles and directions suggests
      they are not important in the thermal emission from the
      ensemble surface.  (2) Rocky playa.  This surface consisted of
      dry playa material, with approximately 10 % of the surface
      covered by rocks with size 1-10 cm.  (3) A&apos;a lava flow.  A 3-m
      square, vegetation-free surface was selected within the Black
      Rock Lava Flow; the surface was extremely rough, with 1-m
      variations in heights occurring.
 
      Four artificial sites were constructed on the Lunar Lake playa.
      The artificial sites consisted of a 1 meter square patch of
      material overlying undisturbed playa material.  The sites were:
      (1) Smooth sand.  Overturned playa material was covered to a
      uniform depth of about 10 cm with sand.  (2) Smooth sand plus a
      single rock.  A similar sand surface was constructed, and a
      single 13-cm cubical rock was placed on top.  (3) Pebble
      surface.  Smooth playa material was covered to a depth of about
      10 cm with 1- to 3-cm rounded pebbles.  (4) Rocky surface.
      Playa material was covered with a close-packed single layer of
      15- to 30-cm slightly weathered and rounded rocks.  After
      construction, each site was allowed to partially equilibrate
      with sunlight and ambient temperatures for 36 hours prior to
      beginning measurements.
 
      Infrared brightness temperature measurements for each surface
      were obtained with a hand-held 8- to 14-micron broadband
      infrared radiometer obtained from the Cole-Parmer Instrument
      Co.  Manufacturer&apos;s specifications indicate an absolute
      calibration to about 3 K, with relative uncertainties between
      measurements of better than 2 K; field investigation suggests a
      relative calibration that was usually better than this over
      short time spans.  Although the field of view of the radiometer
      is small, an internal averaging function allowed the instrument
      to be swept over the entire site in a boustrophedonic pattern
      in order to obtain a reading of the brightness temperature of
      the ensemble surface.  Measurements were made of each site at
      emission angles of 0, 30 and 60 deg, and, for the latter two
      emission angles, every 45 deg of azimuth; measurements of the
      sand and playa sites were obtained at additional emission
      angles.  Experiments were performed to determine the radiometer
      field of view using adjacent surfaces which had differing
      temperatures; the field of view was sufficiently well defined
      that no significant emission was thought to come from regions
      outside of the specific sites.
 
      Measurements of the actual surface kinetic temperature were
      made with a hand-held thermistor probe.  The probe was
      thermally connected to the surface only at the time of the
      measurement and insulated from the atmosphere by a molded piece
      of styrofoam.  The probe itself had a time constant of 10 s in
      air, and was held in contact with each surface for up to 30 s
      to obtain a stable temperature.  For the rocky and rough
      surfaces, temperatures were obtained for a representative
      sampling of surface orientations (typically about 30), and the
      strike and dip of each local surface was recorded.  In order to
      obtain measurements of all surfaces at the same local times,
      data were acquired over a span of three days, partially
      overlapping with other GRSFE field and aircraft investigations.
      Logistical and weather problems prevented obtaining complete
      diurnal coverage of each site.

    Overview
    ========
      The hand-held radiometer is accurate to about 3 K, with
      relative uncertainties between measurements of more than 2 K.
      This work suggests the uncertainties are less over short time
      spans.
