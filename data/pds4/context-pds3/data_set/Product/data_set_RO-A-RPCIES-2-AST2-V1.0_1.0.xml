    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The following describes the nature of instrument operation
      during the various periods for which IES data are available in
      this submission.  In all cases the data are raw electron and
      ion counts as function of energy, azimuth (direction in the
      instrument symmetry plane) and elevation (angle above or below
      the symmetry plane).
 
      This data set includes data obtained by IES during the period
      10 May 2010 to 10 September 2010 (referred to as the AST2
      flyby period by ESA for reference although instrument operation
      was not continuous during this period).  The period between
      10 to 13 July 2010 encompassed the asteroid Lutetia flyby.
 
      The actual flyby of the asteroid occurred on 9 July 2010 when
      IES was not operating.  Thus only solar wind data were obtained.
      During the period between 0300 UTC on 11 July 2010 to 1100 UTC
      on 12 July 2010 no IES data were obtained.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      All Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) data packets are transmitted
      together during downlinks with Rosetta. RPC data are retrieved
      from the Data Distribution System (DDS) at European Space
      Operations Centre (ESOC) to a central RPC data server at
      Imperial College London. Data for IES is copied from the RPC
      central data server by IESGS at Southwest Research Institute.
 
      The pipeline processing software is the IES Ground System
      (IESGS). IESGS extracts IES CCSDS packets from the RPC
      collective data files stored on the RPC central data server at
      Imperial College. These packets are used to build ion and
      electron data products. The data products are grouped by date
      and written out to PDS compliant archive data files. One data
      file is created for each day. IESGS also generates the labels
      for the archive data files. IES science products, archive and
      label files, and limited spectrograms are available to team
      scientists on the IESGS website.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      In order to determine IES pointing, attitude data for the
      Rosetta spacecraft is obtained through SPICE kernels and
      converted from the J2000 coordinate system to the HGRTN
      coordinate system.  HGRTN is the heliocentric RTN system such
      that the sun-spacecraft vector defines the positive x-axis and
      the positive y-axis is the cross-product of the heliographic
      polar axis and the HGRTN positive x-axis. J2000 is the inertial
      frame defined by the intersection of the Earth mean equator and
      the ecliptic plane at the J2000 epoch of January 1, 2000 at
      noon.
 
      The pointing for each bin of IES is thereafter determined by
      multiplying the converted spacecraft attitude matrix in HGRTN
      by the vector representation of each particle measurement bin.
      The resulting vectors represent the flow of particles through
      the respective particle measurement bins in HGRTN coordinates.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This dataset is used by the IES science team after processing.
      This is done to ensure that the archived data contains good,
      valid products.
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by the IES science team
      prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS) and was
      then reviewed by PDS and the Rosetta data archive working group.
      The current set is a resubmission after correcting or
      responding to the various RIDs resulting from that review.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
