 Data Set Overview and Parameters
 ================================
 
The GRS Level 2 data products in this archive include daily
time series of spectra collected by the instrument along with
selected spacecraft engineering and instrument configuration and
orbital ephemerides. Supporting documentation includes as to the
specifics of how these data were generated. Selected ephemerides
and engineering parameters are averaged for the composite set of
information.
 
  Processing
  ==========
 
The Level 2 data products comprise the time series of the GRS
instrument&apos;s science data in physical units. At each integration
time the instrument Data Processing Unit (DPU) samples instrument
spectra accumulated during the integration period as well as
instrument and engineering configuration information.  Ground
processing activities at the University of Arizona produce Derived
Engineering and Spatial Ephemerides information.  The Level-2 data
are then combined into integral products within a relational
database and exported as an integral Level-2 product. Each GRS record
is comprised of the following logical data units:
 
  Spectra:
                      5, (1024 Channel) Spectra
                       (NAI, BGO, ANTI, NAI1, NAI2, BGO1, BGO2)
                       NAI = Sodium Iodide:     Asteroid Pointing
                       BGO = Bismuth Germanate: Asteroid Pointing
                       ANTI= Anti-Coincidence:  Asteroid Pointing
                       NAI1= Sod. Iod 1 Escape: Asteroid Pointing
                       NAI2= Sod. Iod 2 Escape: Asteroid Pointing
                      2, (21 Channel) Spectra
                       BGO1= Bis. Germ. 1 Escpe:Asteroid Pointing
                       BGO2= Bis. Germ. 2 Escpe:Asteroid Pointing
 Instrument HouseKeeping:  Instrument Rates and activity
 Engineering Housekeeping: Engineering Configurations (volts, etc.)
 Derived Engineering:      Ground derived data products
 Spatial                   Orbital Ephemerides
 
   Data and Ancillary Files
   ========================
 
Files for Level-2 are organized into a series of time subdirectories.
 
 
   Coordinate System
   =================
   All products were derived in the Asteroid Body Fixed Coordinate
   System
 
   Software
   ========
   These products were derived from a specialized ground
   processing system developed at the University of Arizona
   Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.  All derived products are
   described in the DOCUMENT Section of this volume:
 
   Requirement Specifications For Level-2 Parameters Required
   Stored or Derived by The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
   (NEAR) Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) Ground System

    Overview
    ========
      Data in this archive have been reduced as part of mission data
      analysis activities of the NEAR XGRS  Science Team.  Data of
      questionable validity have been omitted from the solutions.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the NEAR XGRS
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      It was one of several data sets included in a comprehensive
      review by the PDS Small Bodies Node in August 2001, prior to
      PDS acceptance and ingestion.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      The data included in this archive were collected during the
      NEAR orbital phase from 2000-02-14 to 2001-02-12.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
    None
