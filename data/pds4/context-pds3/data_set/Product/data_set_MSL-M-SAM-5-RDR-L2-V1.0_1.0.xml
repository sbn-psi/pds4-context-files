  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite in the MSL Analytical
    Laboratory is designed to address the present and past
    habilitability of Mars by exploring molecular and elemental
    chemistry relevant to life. SAM addresses carbon chemistry through
    a search for organic compounds, the chemical state of light elements
    other than carbon, and isotopic tracers of planetary change.
 
    SAM is a suite of three instruments: a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer
    (QMS), a Gas Chromatograph (GC), and a Tunable Laser Spectrometer
    (TLS). The QMS and the GC can operate tpgether in a GCMS mode for
    separation (GC) and definitive identification (QMS) or organic
    compounds. The mass range of the QMS is 2-535 Da. The TLS obtains
    precise isotope ratios for C and O in carbon dioxide and H and O in
    water. It also measures trace levels of methane and its carbon
    isotope ratio.
 
    The three SAM instruments are supported by a sample manipulation
    system (SMS) and a Chemical Separation and Processing Laboratory
    (CSPL) that includes high conductance and micro valves, gas
    manifolds with heaters and temperature monitors, chemical and
    mechanical pumps, carrier gas reservoirs and regulators, pressure
    monitors, pyrolysis ovens, and chemical scrubbers and getters. The
    Mars atmosphere is sampled by CSPL valve and pump manipulations
    that introduce an appropriate amount of gas through an inlet tube
    to the SAM instruments.
 
    The solid phase materials are sampled by transporting finely-
    sieved materials to one of 74 SMS sample cups that can then be
    inserted into a SAM oven and thermally processed for release of
    volatiles.
 
    The SAM L2 data set represents the result of science data
    interpretation by the SAM team.
 
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    The SAM L2 data set represents results of data interpretation by
    the SAM science team. It may include the following types of data,
    depending on the experiment sequence:
 
    QMS
    GC
    TLS
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Raw data is delivered to the SAM team as Experiment Data Record
    (EDR) products generated by the Multi-mission Image Processing
    Laboratory (MIPL) at JPL under the Operations Products
    Generation Subsystem (POGS), using the telemetry processing
    software MSLEdrGen. Products are created by MIPL during
    operations from: a) MPCS data products, b) SPICE kernels, and
    c) a meta-data database. They are created on the MSL Operations
    Data Store (ODS) and then deposited intoMIPL&apos;s File Exchange
    Interface (FEI) for electronic distribution to remote sites/
    users via a secure subscription protocol. The EDR product is
    considered NASA packet-level data. SAM EDR data products are
    stored at the PDS for safekeeping but are not formally archived
    in PDS. The SAM team converts raw data to a more manageable
    format, which is stored at PDS as NASA level 0 data. Higher
    level RDR products represent the results of further data
    manipulation and interpretation.Details of processing for
    L2 are discussed below.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The SAM L2 data set is a collection of files containing the
    results of data interpretation by the SAM science team. The
    following types of data may be included, depending on the
    experiment sequence:
 
    QMS DATA
    --------
      QMS L2 data may include gas composition and isotope ratios,
      and gas composition with peak sample temperature
      for EGA runs.
 
    GC DATA
    -------
      GC L2 data may include species identified and their relative
      abundances, for pyrolysis products and derivatized
      compounds.
 
    TLS DATA
    --------
     TLS L2 data include abundance and isotope ratios.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    No ancillary data are provided.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Several coordinate systems are used by the MSL project. A
    detailed description can be found in the SAM RDR SIS document
    found in the Documents directory.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    No SAM specific software is provided with this data set. All
    products are ASCII text, viewable in any text editor. TABLE
    and SPREADSHEET products are also suitable for use in
    spreadsheet and database management programs.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    SAM L2 data represent results of interpretation of science data
    by the SAM team. Accuracy of the data presented here is dependent
    on appropriate use of pre-flight calibration data for preliminary
    corrections.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The SAM RDR was reviewed internally by the SAM team prior
    to release to the PDS. PDS also performed an external peer
    review of the SAM RDR.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    Data reported are the processed data received from the rover
    during nominal SAM operations. This product contains all data
    received from the rover for a single SAM experiment sequence. If
    gaps exist in the telemetry from the rover, data are lost.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
   The L2 data set is limited by any errors in the L1C data set.
