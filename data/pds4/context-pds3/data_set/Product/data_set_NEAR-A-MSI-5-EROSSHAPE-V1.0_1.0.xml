  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This shape model of asteroid 433 Eros is based on 21135 NEAR MSI images
    taken from Feb. 2000 through Feb. 2001.  The shape model was derived by
    Robert Gaskell and is described in Gaskell et al. 2007.  Four levels of
    resolution are included.  Additional information about the method for
    deriving the model may be found in Gaskell et al. 2005.  The version of
    the model included here was prepared on Feb. 23, 2008.
 
    The coordinate system of the model is described in the pck kernel prepared
    by Don Yeomans and Alex Konopliv, &apos;eros_alex.tpc&apos; in the document
    directory.
 
    Number of landmarks:  9002 (90 million vectors)
    Formal position uncertainty:  1.1 m/component
    Number of images: 21135
    Pointing uncertainty:  .025 mrad
    Spacecraft position uncertainty:  0.64 m
    Pointing residuals (relative to catalog file, not CK):  0.55 mrad
    Range residuals (relative to SPKs):  1.21 m
    Number of measurements:  1184010
    Number of measurements per landmark: 131
    RMS LMK location residual:  1.8 m/component
 
    The models were originally prepared in the Implicitly Connected
    Quadrilateral (ICQ) format, and files in four levels of resolution are
    provided in the directory &apos;data/quad&apos;.  The filenames are of the form
    quadxxxq.tab, where xxx is the value of Q (an indicator of the
    resolution).  See below for the full definition of Q and the ICQ format.
 
    The models are also provided in a vertex-facet format, in directory
    &apos;data/vertex&apos;.  The four data files in this subdirectory are derived from
    the ICQ format files in the &apos;data/quad&apos; directory.  The filenames have the
    form verxxxq.tab, where xxx is the value of Q for the original ICQ model.
    In this way it is clear which vertex-facet model comes from which ICQ
    model.
 
    The file &apos;imagelist.tab&apos; is a list of the NEAR MSI images used to generate
    this model.  It is provided in the &apos;data&apos; directory.
 
    A text file, &apos;icqmodel.asc&apos; is provided in the &apos;document&apos; directory which
    describes the ICQ format and the derivation of the vertex-facet versions.
    Some of the information in that file is reproduced below.
 
     ICQ Format Description
      ===============
 
    The global topography models (GTM) are presented here in an implicitly
    connected quadrilateral (ICQ) format.  The vertices are labeled as though
    they were grid points on the faces of a cube
 
                        0 --------- I --------- Q
                     0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     J  .  .  .  . F.  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                     Q  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 
    so that each of the six faces (F) contains (Q+1)^2 vertices v(I,J,F)
    (I=0,Q; J=0,Q) and Q^2 facets f(I,J,F) (I=0,Q-1; J=0,Q-1).  The facet
    f(I,J,F) implicitly has the vertices
      v(I,J,F), v(I,J+1,F), v(I+1,J+1,F), v(I+1,J,F).
 
    If the cube is unfolded, the six faces are arranged as
 
                                           -----------
                                           |         |
                                           |    1    |
                                           |         |
             -----------------------------------------
             |         |         |         |         |
             |    5    |    4    |    3    |    2    |
             |         |         |         |         |
             -----------------------------------------
                                           |         |
                                           |    6    |
                                           |         |
                                           -----------
 
    At each of the 12 edges of the cube, faces share common vertices so that,
    for example, the last row of face 1 has the same vertices as the first row
    of face 2.  The common edge vertices are, with I=(0,Q),
 
                v(I,Q,6)=v(Q-I,Q,4)
                v(I,0,6)=v(I,Q,2)
                v(I,0,5)=v(Q,Q-I,1)
                v(I,0,4)=v(Q-i,0,1)
                v(I,0,3)=v(0,I,1)
                v(I,0,2)=v(I,Q,1)
                v(q,I,6)=v(I,Q,5)
                v(q,I,5)=v(0,I,4)
                v(q,I,4)=v(0,I,3)
                v(q,I,3)=v(0,I,2)
                v(0,I,6)=v(Q-I,Q,3)
                v(0,I,5)=v(Q,I,2)
 
    and the eight corners share vertices from three faces:
 
                v(0,0,1) = v(0,0,3) = v(Q,0,4)
                v(0,Q,1) = v(0,0,2) = v(Q,0,3)
                v(Q,0,1) = v(0,0,4) = v(Q,0,5)
                v(Q,Q,1) = v(0,0,5) = v(Q,0,2)
                v(0,0,6) = v(0,Q,2) = v(Q,Q,3)
                v(0,Q,6) = v(0,Q,3) = v(Q,Q,4)
                v(Q,0,6) = v(0,Q,5) = v(Q,Q,2)
                v(Q,Q,6) = v(0,Q,4) = v(Q,Q,5)
 
    Thus of the 6(Q+1)^2 labeled vertices, only 6Q^2+2 are independent.
 
    The file structure is quite simple.  The first line contains the value of
    Q, and is followed by 6(Q+1)^2 lines containing the vertices.  A piece of
    Fortran code for reading the file would look like:
 
                READ(10,*) Q
                DO F=1,6
                DO J=0,Q
                DO I=0,Q
                  READ(10,*) (V(K,I,J,F), K=1,3)
                ENDDO
                ENDDO
                ENDDO
 
    Here the vertices are represented by three-vectors.  In some cases extra
    components are added representing albedo, color, surface gravity, or other
    surface characteristics.  Since the labeling scheme implicitly contains
    the connectivity, no facet table is necessary.
 
    The quadrilateral facets in the model are not necessarily flat, since
    there is no guarantee that the four vertices are coplanar. The facet
    normals are defined by the cross product of their diagonals.  This
    approximation presents no real difficulty because the spacings of the
    vertices are very small compared to the size of the body.  The standard
    form (Q=512) has 1.57 million vertices.
 
    Although it is not necessary, it is convenient to take Q to be a power of
    2.  Because of this choice, it is easy to &apos;dumb down&apos; a model by
    increasing the spacing by factors of 2.  Vertices of the form v(2I,2J,F)
    are retained and the others discarded.  Because of the quadrilateral facet
    structure, the models can also be &apos;densified&apos; through bilinear
    interpolation.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Note that the vertex-facet versions of the model have some duplicate
    vertices on the edges and corners of the cube.  The duplicate vertices are
    not used in the facet table, resulting in the presence of some vertices in
    the vertex table which do not appear in the facet table.  This does not
    affect the correctness of the vertex-facet version.
