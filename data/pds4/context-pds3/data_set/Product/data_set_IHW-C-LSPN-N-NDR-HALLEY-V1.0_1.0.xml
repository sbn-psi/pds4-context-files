    Data Set Overview
    =================
    NASA&apos;s International Halley Watch (IHW) has created a Comet
    Halley Archive. The collection of data spans the full
    wavelength range as submitted by scientists to the IHW. The
    observations belong to one of the following Disciplines:
    Amateur, Astrometry, Infrared Studies, Large-Scale
    Phenomena, Meteor Studies, Near-Nucleus Studies, Photometry
    and Polarimetry, Radio Studies, and Spectroscopy and
    Spectrophotometry. The data collected by these nine
    disciplines were augmented by Spacecraft measurements. The
    data were submitted to IHW, but the evaluation and selection
    for the Archive has been the primary responsibility of the
    Discipline Specialist Teams for each network in cooperation
    with the Lead Center. The data from the Large-Scale
    Phenomena Network has been organized into a set of digitized
    images and those left in the original analog state for
    reasons of quality, time coverage, or submission problems.
    These latter 1771 pieces of data are held in an archive both
    at Goddard Space Flight Center and with the Small Bodies
    Node of the Planetary Data System. (In the latter case,
    contact specifically the Comet Sub-Node of the PDS at the
    Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics associated with
    the University of Colorado Boulder, for more assistance).
    Some of these analog images are presented in &apos;The
    International Halley Watch Atlas of Large-Scale Phenomena&apos;
    (Brandt, John C., Niedner, Malcolm B. Jr., Rahe, Jurgen,
    1992). The data cover a time range from 1984 December 22
    through 1987 April 26; they are referenced on volumes 19
    through 23 of the IHW Chronological Data Archive Collection
