  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains instrument packet files (IPFs) from the Plasma
    Science experiment (PLS) onboard the Galileo spacecraft during the
    Jupiter orbital operations phase. This data set is a very raw, binary
    form. It is archived for completeness only. There is another PDS data
    set (GO-J-PLS-3-RDR-FULLRES-V1.0) that contains all of the plasma
    detector counts in a form that is much easier to work with. The
    primary advantage of this data set is that it contains instrument
    housekeeping and engineering data in addition to the counts.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    The packetized telemetry files for the PLS instrument are described
    by the Galileo project document &apos;625-205 GLL-3-280 Phase 2: Telemetry
    Measurements and Data Formats, Appendix A&apos;. This document is included
    in the DOCUMENT/PROJECT/GLL3_280 directory of all PDS data volumes
    that include files from this data set. The parameters include both
    analog housekeeping values and digital data.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    These data have been processed only by the Galileo ground data system
    (GDS). The telemetry packets associated  with the PLS experiment have
    been separated from other telemetry packets by the GDS.  In addition,
    there has been  some effort to correct packet header problems
    associated with telemetry dropouts by the GDS.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Each data volume contains a set of as-run spacecraft event files.
    These files collect all of the uplink and downlink commands to the
    spacecraft that affect the PLS instrument. These files are located
    in the DATA/AR_SEF directory of the data volume that contains the PLS
    data files.
 
    In addition, calibration tables and a calibration document have been
    included with this archive, primarily in support of the RDR data
    product mentioned above.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Data are provided in PLS instrument coordinates. Please refer to the
    instrument description paper [FRANKETAL1992] for a description of the
    instrument mounting, detector fields of view, and spin phase
    sectoring. PLS packets contain information about the spacecraft spin
    phase that allows sectors to be computed.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    There are no software provided with this archive.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    These data are archived on CDROM. The data files are  in a complex
    binary format described by the GLL 3-280 document described above.
    Data files are described by detached PDS minimum labels.

  Review
  ======
    These data have been through the Galileo ground data system &apos;besting&apos;
    process and are generally considered to be archive quality raw data.
 
 
  Data Coverage/Quality
  =====================
    All data that was received on the ground from the PLS instrument
    after 1996 are included in this data set. Note that the Io flyby data
    in orbit zero were recorded on tape and not returned until June, 1996.
    This data set contains gaps in coverage. Many of these gaps were
    planned (insufficient telemetry coverage to provide continuous data)
    and others were not (telemetry dropouts, station outages, etc.).
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    These are raw data. No effort has been made to calibrate the data or
    eliminate instrumental effects. Only users who are extremely familiar
    with this instrument and its operation should attempt to use these
    data in this form.
