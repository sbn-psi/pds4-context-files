  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains calibrated, 1.05- to 4.8-micron spectra of Mars
    acquired by the High Resolution Infrared Spectrometer (HRII) for the
    EPOCh project during the second cruise phase of the EPOXI mission.  One
    set of observations was acquired on 20-21 November 2009 to characterize
    Mars as an analog for extrasolar planets.  The observing period lasted
    approximately 24 hours; every two hours spectra were acquired twice
    within a twenty-minute interval.
 
    Every two hours the spacecraft was slewed across the disk of Mars
    six times while the IR spectrometer recorded data.  The scans were
    performed in sets of three as the scan direction was alternated from
    south-to-north, north-to-south, then south-to-north.  Each scan
    (exposure ID) consisted of eight 512x128 binned subframes.  Each set of
    three scans alternated between slower scans with longer frame exposure
    times and faster scans with shorter frame durations.  Each set of three
    scans took about five minutes to acquire.  The position of the IR slit
    with respect to the disk of Mars at the start of each scan and the scan
    rate and direction are provided in EPOCH_MARS_SEQ_2009.PDF, located in
    the document directory.

  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial/along-slit) FITS
    spectral images and PDS labels in this dataset were generated by the
    Deep Impact/EPOXI calibration pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s
    Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  For HRII spectra, the
    pipeline generates two types of calibrated products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be reversible
        because the calibration steps can be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be irreversible because
        the calibration steps, such as smoothing over bad pixels, cannot
        easily be backed out to return to the original, raw data
        numbers.
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes on the raw
    HRII FITS data to produce the RADREV and RAD products found in this
    dataset:
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS header
      - Decompression of compressed images (Mars spectra were not
        compressed)
      - Per-quadrant linearization of raw data numbers
      - Subtraction of dark noise
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk (a unit correction)
      - Division by a flat field, derived for per-quadrant linearization
      - Assignment of spectral registration and bandwidth for each pixel
        (using OPTBENT from FITS headers)
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV) and that was
        derived for per-quadrant linearization
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust.
      - Set non-image pixels at the left, right, and bottom edges to zero in
        the RADREV and RAD products.  The &apos;real data&apos; window of an image
        is given by CALWINDW in the FITS header.  If edge pixels need to be
        analyzed, the original DN values can be found in the raw products
        located in the PDS dataset, DIF-M-HRII-2-EPOXI-MARS-V1.0.
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the per-pixel
    image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps derived for per-pixel linearity (missing pixels were
        identified when the raw FITS files were created).
 
    The pipeline also created FITS image extensions for a spectral
    registration (wavelength) map, a spectral resolution (bandwidth) map,
    and a signal-to-noise ratio map, which are briefly described in the
    next section.  The calibration steps and files applied to each raw
    image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS
    data label.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated spectral image is stored as FITS.  The primary
      data unit contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the
      fastest varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from
      about 1.05 to 4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding
      to the spatial or along-slit dimension.  The primary image is
      followed by four image extensions that are two-dimensional
      pixel-by-pixel maps providing additional information about the
      spectral image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte consisting of eight,
          single-bit flags to describe the quality of each pixel
          in the primary image.  The PDS data label defines the
          purpose of each single-bit flag.
 
        - The second extension provides the spectral registration or
          wavelength for each pixel in the primary image.  This
          extension is required because the wavelength for each
          pixel changes as the temperature of the instrument
          increased or decreased.
 
        - The third extension provides the spectral bandwidth for
          each pixel in the primary image.  This extension is
          required because the bandwidth for each pixel changes as
          the temperature of the instrument increased or decreased.
 
        - The fourth extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a data label and provides more information about the FITS primary
      image and the extensions.  Many values in a data label were
      extracted from FITS image header keywords which are defined in the
      document EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and
      EPOXI documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V4.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HIyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;HI&apos; identifies the HRII
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images can be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Spectral scans often had 32 or more frames for one specific exposure.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      frame number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in
      the data labels.  For example, if 8 frames were commanded for a scan
      with an exposure ID of 1000002, the first FITS file name would be
      HI09112011_1000002_001_RR.FIT and the last would be
      HI09112011_1000002_008_RR.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All data products in this dataset are uncompressed.  Specifically
      all raw Mars spectral images were never compressed.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when it is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Spectral Scans
    --------------
      Each IR scan across Mars consists of eight frames for one exposure
      ID (OBSERVATION_ID in the data labels).  To work with these spectral
      scans, it is recommended that all frames for one exposure ID be
      stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a spatial-spatial map
      can be produced for a specific wavelength by selecting the appropriate
      spectral column from the image cube.  Spectral wavelengths are
      provided by the second FITS extension, the spectral registration
      (wavelength) map.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      For a comparison of the relative locations of the IR slit with
      respect to the fields of view of the Medium Resolution Instrument
      Visible CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV), see the instrument alignment section of the EPOXI SIS
      document or Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
      There are no visible CCD context images provided in this dataset to
      aid in orienting the IR slit location with the nucleus during a
      particular observation.  In many cases, nearly simultaneous MRI
      frames, located in the dataset DIF-M-MRI-3/4-EPOXI-MARS-V2.0,
      were acquired during the IR scans and may provide field of view
      context for the slit location.

    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction is
      vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out from the
      left and right edges and toward the center and starting with the
      first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at the top of
      the display.  Since the detector is reset and read out on a
      pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at which
      each pixel is exposed although each pixel has the same exposure
      duration -- except for the ALTFF mode that has different read and
      reset causing the effective exposure time to vary with line number,
      i.e., along the slit in the spatial direction.  Additionally, the end
      of the spectrometer slit that always points roughly towards the sun
      is the first line to be readout and the last line to be read out is
      furthest from the sun, assuming the spacecraft is in its usual
      orientation with the solar panels pointing roughly toward the sun.
      For more information about the timing of the spectra, see the zero
      exposure background section of the EPOXI instrument calibration paper
      by Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Calibrated RADREV and RAD spectral images have units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      One mode was used for all images in this dataset:
 
                    X-Size  Y-Size  Bin
        Mode Name   (pix)   (pix)  Type  Comments
        ---- ------ ------  -----  ----- ------------------
          2  BINSF1   512     126   2x2  Binned sub-frame
 
      In the table above, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is
      the spatial dimension.  For more information see the EPOXI SIS and
      EPOXI Calibration Pipeline Summary documents, Hampton, et al. (2005)
      [HAMPTONETAL2005], and Klaasen, et al. (2013) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For Mars observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time, and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  Most kernels are available in the EPOXI
    SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0; others that had not yet been
    archived in the PDS when this dataset was produced are available online
    at the Operational Flight Project Kernels website maintained by the
    NASA Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF),
    http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data_operational.html.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels, unless specified otherwise (e.g,
    SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This dataset was originally peer reviewed in September 2010 but were
    rejected due to an error in the absolute calibration that inflated
    all spectra by a factor of 2.  The data were reprocessed in 2013
    with the correct absolute calibration, internally verified by the
    EPOXI project, then submitted for another peer review in March 2014.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset was peer reviewed and certified for scientific use on
    21 March 2014.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All Mars observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this dataset.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      An improved operations spacecraft clock SPICE kernel,
      DIF_SCLKSCET.00119.TSC, was used to convert to UTC and to calculate
      geometry-related parameters for this dataset.  Therefore observation
      times for these calibrated images are improved and differ at the
      sub-second level when compared to the archived raw images.
 
      The EPOXI project plans to generate a complete and highly accurate
      set of UTC correlations since launch.  This will ultimately result
      in a future version of a SCLK kernel that will retroactively change
      correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI data.  When this
      kernel is available, it will be added to the SPICE datasets for
      the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE web site at
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
     HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in 2005
      indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus
      problem does not significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more
      details, please see the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen,
      et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels are included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the EPOXI:MINIMUM and EPOXI:MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the reference rows and columns
      located at the edges of the image.  For more information, see the
      quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
