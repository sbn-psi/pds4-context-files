Data Set Overview
=================
 
 
The data from the ROSETTA PLASMA CONSORTIUM (RPC) Fluxgate
Magnetometer(MAG)was submitted by Ingo Richter (TM) for the RPCMAG
team. The PI of the team is Karl-Heinz Glassmeier.
 
 
The data have been measured during
 
 -the  STEINS flyby between
  September 1 and September 10, 2008
 
The closest approach (CA) took place on September 5, 2008 at 18:38
 
 
All magnetic field data are calibrated, resampled data. That means the
data represent the 3 components of the magnetic field measured in
physical units (nT). Calibration has been applied according to the
Ground calibration results which means:
- temperature dependent offset calibration
- temperature dependent sensitivity calibration
- temperature dependent misalignment calibration
 
 
Data are given in different coordinates, dependent on the calibration
LEVEL.
 
 LEVEL_F :  averaged data in s/c-coordinates
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_B or LEVEL_K data.
 
 LEVEL_G :  averaged data in ECLIPJ2000-coordinates
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_C or LEVEL_L data.
 
 LEVEL_H :  averaged data in ECLIPJ2000-coordinates,
            Reaction wheel influence eliminated,
            Data available for disturbed times only
            Source of these data are either LEVEL_C or LEVEL_L data.
 
 
Bad vectors have been removed. Any s/c caused residual magnetic fields
are not eliminated. The ground temperature model for the sensor
calibration has been improved (expanded for a wider temperature range
down to - 130 deg C) using long term temperature model obtained
from flight data.
The data are sorted by the sensor (OB: outboard sensor, IB: inboard
sensor)and the measurement mode (M1..M6) and average interval (A&lt;n&gt;,
where n denotes the average interval in seconds). Data can uniquely be
identified by their file names.
Averaging means calculating a mean value of of the specified interval
in time domain. It does not mean any mixing of data from the OB and IB
sensor.
 
Normally the OB is the Primary (Pri) and the IB is the Secondary (Sec)
sensor. However, this order can be toggled by TCs. This feature has
been tested especially during the commissioning phases.
 
In cases were the PRIMARY and SECONDARY sensor were toggled the
individual data files (OB/IB) will contain data measured with
different sampling rates according to the actual sampling rates of
the PRIMARY and SECONDARY sensors. Refer to the MODE DESCRIPTION
table below. The actual sampling rate is the only indicator
showing which sensor is the primary and which is the secondary
one.
 
 
LEVEL_H data were only generated if the  signature of the Reaction
wheel rotations showed up in the calibrated data. A correction could
be achieved for only for higher frequently sampled data. For sample
rates below one Hertz the disturbing spectrum of the Reaction Wheels
can hardly be distinguished from the background spectrum. Therefore
only burst mode data of the OB sensor are corrected.

FILENAME CONVENTION &amp; Mode Coding
===================================
Due to operational constraints it might happen that the instrument
mode or the primary sensor has to be switched during a specific
observation.
The actual mode and the primary sensor of the instrument can easily
be identified by analyzing the filename of the actual data files. The
complete filename convention is listed in the EAICD, chapter 3.1.4.
 
The filenames for RESAMPLED averaged data (CLE,CLF,CLG,CLI) are coded
as follows:
 
&lt;inst&gt;  &lt;begin of observation&gt;_&lt;level&gt;_&lt;sensor&gt;_A&lt;average&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;
RPCMAG          yymmdd           CLE      IB    A60         LBL
                                 CLF      OB                TAB
                                 CLG
                                 CLI
 
 
Example: RPCMAG040528_CLG_OB_A20.LBL
         RPCMAG040528_CLG_OB_A20.TAB
 
Average denotes the time interval for one average period in seconds.
 
 
The filenames for RESAMPLED Heater or Reaction Wheel influenced data
(CLK, CLL, CLH)  are coded as follows:
 
&lt;inst&gt;  &lt;begin of observation&gt;_&lt;level&gt;_&lt;sensor&gt;_&lt;inst mode&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;
RPCMAG         yymmddThhmm       CLK      IB      M1..M6      LBL
