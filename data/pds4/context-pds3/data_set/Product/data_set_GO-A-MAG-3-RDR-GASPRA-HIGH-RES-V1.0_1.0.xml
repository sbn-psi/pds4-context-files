  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains data acquired by the Galileo Magnetometer from
    the Gaspra encounter. The data are at the full instrument resolution
    for the 7.68 kB Low Rate Science (LRS) real time telemetry mode.
    These data have been fully processed to remove instrument response
    function characteristics and interference from magnetic sources
    aboard the spacecraft. The data are provided in physical units
    (nanoTesla) in 4 coordinate systems. One set of data files contain
    data in Inertial Rotor Coordinates (IRC = despun spacecraft). These
    files include many of the data processing parameters from the AACS
    system as well as the sensor zero levels. The other set of files
    contain magnetic field data in Gaspra-centric Solar Ecliptic (GaSE),
    Earth Mean Equatorial equinox 1950 (EME-50), and finally in
    Heliographic (RTN) coordinates.
 
    Trajectory data are provided as a separate dataset for each of the
    geophysical coordinate systems.

    Data Acquisition
    ----------------
      The data were acquired by the Galileo Magnetometer in the normal
      Low Rate Science (LRS) manner except that the data were recorded
      to tape and played back during the Earth 2 encounter. The data
      were acquired by the outboard magnetometer in the flip left
      position and the low range (high gain) mode.
 
      The Galileo magnetometer has 8 possible LRS acquisition
      configurations (modes). There are two sensor triads mounted 7 and
      11 meters from the rotor spin axis (inboard and outboard) along
      the boom. Each of the sensor triads has two gain states (high and
      low).  In addition, the sensor triads can be &apos;flipped&apos; to move the
      spacecraft spin-axis aligned sensor into the spin plane and visa
      versa. Please see the instrument description for full details on
      the instrument, sensors, and geometries. The combinations of
      sensor, gain state, and flip direction form modes.

    Data Sampling
    -------------
      The Galileo magnetometer samples the magnetic field 30 times per
      second.  In order to reduce the data rate to the MAG LRS rate, the
      instrument performs an onboard averaging process.
 
        Recursive Filter:
 
        B(t) = 1/4 Bs(t) + 3/4 B(t-1)
 
        B  = output field
        Bs = input field measured by the sensor
        t  = sample time
 
      The high rate samples are recursively filtered and then resampled
      by the instrument at 4.5 vectors per second using a 7,7,6
      decimation pattern. The pattern is generated by doubling the
      spacecraft clock modulo 10 counter and then applying the
      decimation scheme. This gives 3 vectors every spacecraft minor
      frame (about 2/3 second) which are sampled unevenly. The first
      vector in a minor frame is sampled approximately 0.200 seconds
      after the last vector in the preceding minor frame. The other two
      samples are taken approximately 0.233 seconds apart. The time tag
      associated with a sample is the decimation time.
 
 
  Coordinate Systems
  ==================
    The Galileo magnetometer data are being archived in 4 coordinate
    systems.  The first coordinate system is referred to as inertial
    rotor coordinates (IRC). This coordinate system has the Z axis along
    the rotor spin axis, positive away from the antenna and the X and Y
    axes lies in the rotor spin plane. In a crude sense, when the
    spacecraft is far from Earth, +X points south, normal to the
    ecliptic plane, positive Y lies in the ecliptic plane in the sense
    of Jupiter&apos;s orbital motion and positive Z is in the anti-earth
    direction. The spacecraft antenna (negative Z direction) is kept
    earthward pointing to about +/- 10 deg accuracy.
 
    Gaspracentric Solar Ecliptic (GaSE) is a Gaspra centered coordinate
    system defined by the primary vector along the instantaneous
    Gaspra-&gt;Sun (GSun) line and the Earth&apos;s ecliptic north pole (ENP) as
    the secondary vector. In this coordinate system:
 
      X is the GSun unit vector taken to be positive towards the Sun.
      Y is the formed by the unitized cross product ENP x GSun
      Z completes the right handed set (Z = X x Y)
 
    such that the X-Z plane contains the ecliptic north pole.
 
    The Earth Mean Equatorial equinox of 1950 (EME-50) coordinate system
    is an inertial reference system. The primary vector in this system
    points from the Earth towards Aries at the reference epoch. The
    secondary vector is along the Earth&apos;s rotational axis positive
    towards it&apos;s north pole. In this coordinate system:
 
      X is a unit vector in the direction of Aries at the equinox
        of 1950
      Y is a unit vector in the direction of Z x X
      Z is a unit vector in the direction of the Earth&apos;s equatorial
        north pole at the equinox of 1950.
 
    The EME-50 coordinate system is directly supported by SPICE as the
    &apos;FK4&apos; inertial reference frame.
 
    The heliographic (RTN) coordinate system centered at the Sun. The
    primary vector in this system points from the center of the Sun to
    the spacecraft (R).  The secondary vector in this system is the
    Sun&apos;s north rotational axis (Omega).
 
      R is along R, positive away from the Sun.
      T is along the cross product Omega x R
      N completes the right handed set (R x T)
 
    The magnetic field perturbation associated with the Gaspra flyby
    [KIVELSONETAL1993] is most easily understood in a coordinate system
    that is organized by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The
    IMF coordinate system used by [KIVELSONETAL1993] to analyze the
    Gaspra flyby data takes data from the GaSE coordinate system and
    rotates about the Asteroid-Sun line (X) such that the average
    upstream IMF direction (between 22:30 and 22:33 UT) lies in the X-Y
    plane. This requires a righthanded rotation of 32.44 degrees about
    the GaSE X-axis to generate By_imf and Bz_imf from By_GaSe and
    Bz_GaSE. An IMF coordinate system is only valid for a short
    interval near the time interval that defines the IMF direction.
    [KIVELSONETAL1993] use this coordinate system only in the analysis
    of data acquired between 22:15 and 23:05 UT on the day of encounter
    (10/29/91).
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    A subset of the Galileo interplanetary cruise magnetometer dataset
    (GO-SS-MAG-4-SUMM-CRUISE-RTN-V1.0) has been supplied as an ancillary
    data product with this archive. The cruise data are provided to
    place the encounter data in context with large scale structures in
    the solar wind and IMF. These data are provided in RTN coordinates
    which is a standard coordinate system for solar wind data analysis.
    The time interval provided (9/10/91 - 11/24/91) spans roughly 3
    solar rotations centered on the asteroid flyby. These data show that
    the Gaspra encounter occurred in an &apos;away&apos; sector a day or so before
    a large field compression associated with a corotating interaction
    region. The data are stored as an ASCII table in the file
    &apos;CRUISE.TAB&apos;.

  Data Processing
  ===============
    These data have been processed from the PDS dataset:
    &apos;GO-E/V/A-MAG-2-RDR-RAWDATA-HIRES-V1.0&apos;
 
    The &apos;raw data&apos; product was created from the EDR dataset by removing
    the data processing done by the instrument in space. The raw data
    dataset contains the raw instrument samples which have been
    recursively filtered and decimated as described above. The processed
    data in IRC coordinates were rotated into geophysical coordinates
    using the SPICE libraries and kernels provided by NAIF.  In order to
    generate the IRC processed data, the following procedure was
    followed:
 
      1) Sensor zero level corrections were subtracted from the raw
         data,
      2) Data were converted to nanoTesla,
      3) A coupling matrix which orthogonalizes the data and corrects
         for gains was applied to the data (calibration applied),
      4) Magnetic sources associated with the spacecraft were subtracted
         from the data,
      5) Data were &apos;despun&apos; into inertial rotor coordinates,
 
      1) Zero level determination: The zero levels of the two spin plane
         sensors were determined by taking averages over a large number
         (about 50) of integral spin cycles. The zero level of the spin
         axis aligned sensor was determined by a variety of means.
         First, since the spin axis aligned sensor can be flipped into
         the spin plane, the value of the zero level determined in the
         spin plane can be used in the other geometry. This works well
         if there are no spacecraft fields and the zero level is stable.
 
         If there are spacecraft fields present which remain constant
         over relatively long time periods (many hours), then another
         method of zero level determination is used. The spacecraft spin
         axis is along the Z direction, the data in the X and Y
         directions have already had zero level corrections applied.
 
           Bm(z)  = B(z)   + O(z)
          |Bm|^2  = B(x)^2 + B(y)^2 + Bm(z)^2
                  = B(x)^2 + B(y)^2 + B(z)^2 + O(z)^2 + 2B(z)O(z)
                  = |B|^2  + O(z)^2 + 2B(z)O(z)
                  = |B|^2  + O(z)^2 + 2O(z)[Bm(z) - O(z)]
                  = |B|^2  - O(z)^2 + 2O(z)Bm(z)
 
           m = measured value    -    no subscript = true value
 
         Now if |B| remains constant over a short interval and O(z)
         remains constant over a much longer interval, we can take
         averages and reduce this equation to:
 
           |Bm|^2 - &lt;|Bm|^2&gt; =  2O(z)[Bm(z) - &lt;Bm(z)&gt;]
 
           &lt;&gt; indicates average value
 
         Data can be processed using short averages of |B| until many
         points are accumulated and then fit with a line in a least
         squares sense. The slope of this line is twice the required
         offset. The scatter in the data give an indication of the error
         in the assumption the |B| and O(z) have remained constant.
         Intervals with large rms errors are not retained. The zero
         levels removed from the data are given in the IRC data file.
 
      2) Conversion to nanoTesla simply requires dividing the instrument
         data numbers by a constant scale factor. For the inboard high
         range (low gain) mode the scale factor is 2. For the inboard
         low range and outboard high range, the scale factor is 64. The
         outboard low range data has a scale factor of 1024.
 
      3) Calibration matrix applied: The determination of a calibration
         matrix is too complex to describe here. The method employed has
         been well described in [KEPKOETAL1996].
 
      4) After the data were initially processed (calibrated and
         despun), it was clear that there were still coherent noise
         sources remaining in the data. Dynamic spectra of the
         magnetometer data revealed coherent energy at high order (2nd,
         3rd, 4th) harmonics of the spin period. High order harmonics of
         the spin period can be generated by spinning about a fixed
         dipole source such as a source on the despun platform. The
         source of the high order harmonics was modeled using 1-D
         (spacecraft clock angle) Fourier transforms of high pass
         filtered data. This allows us to resolve the source in terms of
         the relative spin phase of the scan platform. Model fields
         associated with this source (approximately 0.15 nT at the
         inboard sensors in the lowest harmonic) have been subtracted
         from the data.
 
      5) Despinning: Data are despun and checked in inertial rotor
         coordinates before transforming to geophysical coordinates. Any
         errors in the processing will be most readily apparent in
         inertial rotor coordinates.  The  nominal transformation to IRC
         from SRC is
 
           (Bx)   ( cos(theta)   -sin(theta)  0 ) (Bxs)
           (By) = ( sin(theta)    cos(theta)  0 ) (Bys)
           (Bz)   (   0               0       1 ) (Bzs)
 
         Where s denotes spinning coordinates and theta is the rotor
         spin angle.
 
         Frequency dependent phase delays associated with the analog
         anti-aliasing filter and the digital recursive filter have been
         removed during the despinning of the data. The dominant
         frequency in the spinning data is at the spacecraft spin
         frequency. The phase angle delay associated from all known
         sources is computed at the spin frequency and removed from the
         data during despinning.
 
         Analog Filter:            Digital Filter (Nyquist Freq Fn = 15Hz)
 
                  1543                         1/3
           ------------------         ---------------------
           s^2 + 55.5s + 1543         4/3 - exp(-PI*i*f/Fn)
 
           s = 2*PI*i*f
 
           Imaginary = 55.5s          Imaginary = -sin(PI*f/Fn)
           Real      = 1543 + s^2     Real      = 4/3 - cos(PI*f/FREQ_N)
 
           f = frequency
           delay = tan^-1(Im/Re)
 
         In addition, there is an electrical delay associated with the
         A/D conversion of about .037 milliseconds. This delay is
         converted to an angle using the instantaneous spin frequency.
         These 3 sources of delay are then summed in to the quantity
         &apos;phase&apos; and then the despinning matrix becomes:
 
           (Bx)   ( cos(theta - phase)   -sin(theta - phase)  0 ) (Bxs)
           (By) = ( sin(theta - phase)    cos(theta - phase)  0 ) (Bys)
           (Bz)   (      0                          0         1 ) (Bzs)
 
      6) Data was transformed to geophysical coordinates: Data are
         transformed from inertial rotor coordinates to the Earth Mean
         Equatorial (equinox 1950) coordinate system. This system is
         directly supported by the SPICE software provided by the
         Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL as
         inertial coordinate system &apos;FK4&apos;. The angles required for this
         transformation come directly from the Galileo Attitude and
         Articulation Control System (AACS) data. The transformation
         matrix for this rotation is:
 
      --                                                             --
      |(cosTsinDcosR - sinTsinR)  (-sinDsinTcosR - cosTsinR)  cosDcosR|
      |                                                               |
      |(cosTsinDsinR + sinTcosR)  (-sinDsinTsinR + cosTcosR)  cosDsinR|
      |                                                               |
      |-cosDcosT                  sinTcosD                      sinD  |
      --                                                            --
 
         where
 
           R = Rotor-Right Ascension
           D = Rotor-Declination
           T = Rotor-Twist - Rotor-Spin-angle  (despun data)
 
         Once in an inertial coordinate system, SPICE software provides
         subroutines which allow a user to construct coordinate system
         transformation matrices for any ephemeris time. These matrices
         were constructed from the SPICE kernels by directly or
         indirectly extracting the primary and secondary vectors
         defining the coordinate system and then following the procedure
         outlined in the coordinate systems section of this document.
         The spacecraft/planet (SPK), leap second (TS), and planetary
         constants (PCK) kernels required for these transformations have
         been archived in the PDS by NAIF. These SPICE kernels are
         available on the CD_ROM which contains the magnetometer data.
         The SPICE toolkit (software) can be obtained from the NAIF node
         of the PDS for many different platforms and operating systems.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Data quality assessment is a rather vague concept which we will try
    to address in a somewhat qualitative manner. Each aspect of the data
    processing sequence can be analyzed to determine its maximum
    possible error contribution. In theory, these errors could be summed
    to provide estimates of the maximum error for each data point. We
    have not taken our error analysis to that level. We believe that our
    calibrations (sensor geometry and gains) are good enough that they
    produce a negligible source of data error. In addition, we believe
    that the coordinate system transformations which are derived from
    the SPICE kernels and Toolkit are negligible sources of error in the
    magnetic field vectors. The sources of error which we feel are the
    most significant are those associated with magnetic sources aboard
    the spacecraft, especially those with temporal or spacecraft
    orientation variations. The next greatest contributor of error is
    the data from the AACS which affects our knowledge of the spacecraft
    orientation and hence rotates the magnetic field vector. Lastly,
    telemetry or software errors which produce &apos;spikes&apos; or bit errors in
    the data are error sources.
 
    In regions where the magnetic sources associated with the spacecraft
    are fairly constant, magnetic interference is probably reduced by
    data processing to better than 0.01 nT at the inboard sensors. In
    these same regions, sensor zero levels (offsets) are known equally
    well. The data processing software does a fairly good job of
    removing all currently identified sources of magnetic interference.
 
    Our data processing software creates a data quality flag (dqf) which
    is an assessment of AACS and telemetry error source contamination of
    a given data point. This number is binary integer where each bit
    indicates the presence or absence of some error source. The number 0
    represents the absence of all error sources which are tested. The
    higher order bit (larger number) error sources are considered to be
    more significant error sources. Data are examined for gradients in
    the field which might be associated with telemetry bit errors, for
    regions of bad AACS angles, and for completely missing data. If the
    error is considered completely unrecoverable, the data values are
    replaced with a missing data flag. In the case of a flag in the
    rotor spin angle, the vector components may be flagged but the
    magnitude is still valid. Here is a list of all of the error checks
    and the bits they set in the dqf field.

    DQF_BZ_FLAG                 2^30 Component flagged
 
    Magnetic field gradient warning or error levels are set during the
    data processing according to expected variances depending on the
    region of space.  In the solar wind, gradient warnings are usually
    issued at gradients of 10 nT/sec and errors at 15 nT/sec. AACS
    angles are interpolated across gaps during the processing if the gap
    length is relatively short (less than 10 minutes typically). If the
    gaps in spacecraft attitude are long, the AACS angles are flagged
    and not interpolated.
 
    Errors associated with AACS angles have various effects on the
    data.  The rotor right ascension and declination are crucial to the
    understanding of the spacecraft orientation. Fortunately, these
    angles are slowly varying and can be interpolated to better than 1
    degree of accuracy for long (many hour) time periods except near
    major spacecraft maneuvers. The relative clock and cone angles are
    used to remove scan platform interference. In their absence, no
    interference is removed (+/- 0.15 nT error possible in each
    component). The rotor motion spin delta is used to determine the
    instantaneous spin frequency for the phase delay computation. In its
    absence, the last known phase delay is applied to the current data
    point. The rotor spin angle and twist angle must be present in order
    to despin the data. These angles are generally not interpolated for
    more than ten minutes because the rotor spin period drifts over time
    periods on this order.
