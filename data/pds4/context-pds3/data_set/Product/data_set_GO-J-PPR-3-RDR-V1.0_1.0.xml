Data Set Overview
=================
 
The Photopolarimeter/Radiometer (PPR) subsystem is one of the four
remote sensing instruments mounted on the Galileo Orbiter scan
platform and is designed to measure the degree of linear polarization
and intensity of reflected or scattered sunlight and the intensity of
thermally emitted radiation from Jupiter and its major satellites.
Primary science objectives and anticipated results of the PPR
experiment are to: (1) determine the vertical and horizontal
distribution of cloud and haze particles in the atmosphere of Jupiter;
(2) determine the energy budget of Jupiter and the variation in the
amount and spatial distribution of reflected solar radiation and
emitted thermal radiation for Jupiter and its satellites, including
the thermal structure of the atmosphere of Jupiter; and (3) measure
and map the photometric, polarimetric, and thermal radiometric
properties of the major satellites of Jupiter.  These objectives of
course contribute to the broader goals of the Galileo Mission science
disciplines of atmospheres and satellites as planned and coordinated
by the Atmospheres Working Group (AWG) and the Satellite Working Group
(SWG).
 
With the Galileo Orbiter constrained to use the low-gain antenna, the
Jupiter Phase mission planning was necessarily predicated on the
strategy of recording most of the observations by the remote sensing
instruments during each encounter period, or Jupiter and satellite
close approach, for playback during the long cruise portions of the
eccentric orbits.  As a consequence, the key spacecraft resources for
science operations were Data Memory System (DMS) track usage, bits-to-
ground as a measure of downlink telemetry capability, and propellant
for spacecraft attitude reorientation, or science turns.  Initial
planning by the Galileo Project Science Group (PSG) thus entailed the
allocation of spacecraft resources to the three science disciplines -
atmospheres, magnetosphere, and satellites - with the respective
working groups planning and coordinating specific observations, or
Orbit Activity Plan ELements (OAPELs).  The resulting plans are
summarized in the Orbit Planning Guide (OPG; [GLLOPG]).
 
The OPG summarizes the basic science objectives for each discipline
and describes the strategies that were adopted given the resources
allocated to each WG.  For the AWG, the strategy was to focus on
integrated studies of a variety of atmospheric features and to
emphasize observations that are unique in terms of instrumental
capability or observing geometry opportunities.  For the SWG, the
objective was to obtain global coverage of the satellites at modest
spatial resolution consistent with resources and to emphasize small
regions of interest for high spatial resolution and full multispectral
coverage.  AWG and SWG objectives required coordinated observations by
two or more of the four scan platform instruments as well as some
observations by individual instruments.
 
AWG Science Objectives and Observation Strategy:
 
Atmospheric science objectives for the Galileo Mission were to: (1)
determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere; (2) determine
the structure of the atmosphere to a depth of at least 10 bars; (3)
determine the nature of the cloud particles and the location and
structure of the cloud layers; (4) determine the radiative energy
balance in the atmosphere; (5) investigate the circulation and
dynamics of the atmosphere; and (6) investigate the upper atmosphere
and ionosphere.  The Galileo Probe addressed these objectives at one
location and time, while the Orbiter observations are essential for
completing the picture by providing spatial and temporal coverage.
Observations by the remote sensing instruments on the Orbiter provide
high spatial resolution with broad spectral and phase angle coverage.
In general, coordinated observations by the scan platform instruments
are the optimum strategy because of the broad spectral coverage thus
afforded.  While many of the AWG observations were accordingly
coordinated, the planned sequences typically involved distinct OAPELs
for the individual instruments closely spaced in time rather than
actually simultaneous measurements because of practical issues of
efficient DMS tape usage.
 
Since the number of image frames from the Solid State Imaging (SSI)
system was rather restricted for the low-gain antenna mission, the AWG
emphasized the observation of discrete atmospheric features utilizing
joint remote sensing by the scan platform instruments.  So the primary
AWG observational objective was for local regions defined by spatial
scales of about 10,000 km, to determine the temperature structure,
distribution of minor gaseous constituents, properties of the clouds,
radiative energy budget, and wind field from observations at the
highest spatial resolution over a range of emission and phase angles.
These local regions included the Probe Entry Site, shearing regions at
the edges of jets, white ovals, brown &apos;barges&apos;, infrared &apos;hot spots&apos;,
and equatorial plumes.  Because of the need to obtain SSI frames
spaced appropriately in time for determining cloud motions and to
obtain a range of emission and phase angles, these observations were
called feature tracks.  Features covering a broader area are also
important, but their coverage could not involve joint observations by
all remote sensing instruments at their fullest capabilities.  These
regions included the Great Red Spot (GRS), the North and South Polar
Regions, and two stable axisymmetric features: South Tropical Zone
(STrZ) and North Equatorial Belt (NEB).  In order to establish
context, to study zonal wave structure, and to provide a modest survey
for temporal variations, global observations by individual instruments
were planned on a very limited basis.  Finally, given the limitations
of local or regional feature characterization and the relatively
modest opportunities for complete longitudinal coverage in global
maps, meridional scans were employed to provide sensitive studies of
meridional variability of temperature, composition, or cloud
properties.
 
PPR observations in support of the AWG strategy are characterized by
the following OAPEL types:
1) FTBAS:  Basic feature track support; observes the local regions in
both radiometry and photopolarimetry as part of the atmospheric
feature campaign involving all the remote sensing instruments.
2) FTPOL:  Adds feature track coverage to FTBAS in photopolarimetry at
other phase angles.
3) FTRAD:  Repeat of feature track in FTBAS in radiometry at different
emission angle.
4) REGMAP:  Characterize properties of a region larger than the
standard feature track; nominally 4 times larger in both dimensions.
5) GLOBAL:  Global map with complete coverage over 360 degrees of
longitude with variable latitude range.
6) NSSTRP:  North-south stripe provides pole-to-pole coverage at
selected longitudes, sometimes selected to pass through features
observed in feature track or regional map observations.
 
SWG Science Objectives and Observation Strategy:
 
Satellite science objectives for the Galileo Mission were to: (1)
characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the
satellite surfaces; (2) investigate the surface mineralogy of the
satellites and determine the distribution of the compositional units;
(3) determine the gravitational fields, magnetic fields, and dynamical
properties of the satellites; and (4) study satellite atmospheres and
ionospheres, extended gas clouds arising from the satellites, and
interactions with the magnetosphere.  Observations to achieve the
satellite science objectives have far less emphasis on coordinated
measurements by the scan platform instruments than that for
atmospheres, but instead are often focussed on timing of specific
observations within the context of the satellite encounter geometry.
 
Principal PPR satellite science objectives are: (1) characterizing the
nature of current Io volcanism including temporal variability; (2) the
search for possible internal activity on Europa and delineation of
Europa&apos;s surface thermophysical properties; (3) characterizing the
surface physical and optical properties with photopolarimetric phase
observations; (4) determining global surface thermophysical property
variations and surface volatile stability on Ganymede and Callisto;
and (5) obtaining absolute temperature distribution maps.  The PPR
OAPEL types employed to obtain appropriate observations to realize
these objectives are:
1) DGTM (Dayside Global Thermal Map):  Determine global daytime
brightness temperature with highest possible spatial resolution as a
function of wavelength to characterize global variations in surface
compaction, its correlation with geological unit, and its possible use
for evaluating surface ages, emplacement mechanisms, or compositions;
investigate sub-resolution temperature variations as probes of surface
roughness and local albedo distribution; and evaluate stability of
volatiles on the surface.
2) TPO (Thermal Phase Observation):  Observe the variation in
brightness temperature of a particular point on the surface when seen
from different directions to improve the determination of kinetic
surface temperatures.
3) DRKMAP (Darkside Map):  Determine global nighttime brightness
temperatures with highest possible spatial resolution as a function of
wavelength to characterize global variations in surface compaction,
its correlation with geological unit, and its possible use for
evaluating surface ages, emplacement mechanisms, or compositions and
to look for possible sources of endogenic heat for Europa.
4) HIRESS (High Resolution Samples):  Determine brightness temperature
distribution for small areas near closest approach to characterize
local variations in surface properties, evaluate stability of
volatiles on the surface, and look for possible sources of endogenic
heat for Europa.
5) PPO (Polarimetry Phase Observation):  Measure polarization of
reflected sunlight as a function of phase angle to infer grain sizes
and refractive index of surface particles.
6) IOLITE (Io Bright-Side Monitoring):  Map thermal emission as a
function of wavelength with best possible spatial resolution on
several orbits to characterize spatial distribution and temporal
variability of large, low-temperature, high power hot spots on Io&apos;s
sunlit hemisphere.
7) IOMON (Io Monitoring):  Map thermal emission as a function of
wavelength with best possible spatial resolution on several orbits to
characterize spatial distribution and temporal variability of large,
low-temperature, high power hot spots.
 
As indicated in the Orbit Planning Guide, the Galileo Orbiter Jupiter
Phase began with the approach to Jupiter and orbit insertion (JA/J0)
followed by the prime mission with a tour of eleven orbits around
Jupiter.  NASA approved the Galileo Europa Mission (GEM) to follow the
prime mission with a tour of fourteen more orbits with a focus on
Europa and concluding with two encounters of Io.  The Io encounters
were placed at the end of GEM because of the increased risk to the
spacecraft and instruments from the intense radiation expected at that
closer approach to Jupiter.  Despite some effects attributable to the
radiation, the overall Galileo Orbiter health remained quite good, and
NASA thus approved a further extended tour, the Galileo Millennium
Mission (GMM), which among a number of objectives, permitted observations
from two platforms as the Cassini spacecraft made its Jupiter
flyby in late 2000 on its way to Saturn.  The tours were shaped by
close, or targeted, encounters with Ganymede, Europa, Callisto, and
Io, with one such encounter on each orbit except numbers 5 and 13,
which were used as &apos;phasing orbits&apos; with no planned encounter science
owing to the effect of Jupiter solar conjunction on telemetry.  There
were in addition to the targeted encounters, non-targeted satellite
encounters that permitted observations at intermediate ranges for a
number of the orbits.  The convention adopted for designating the tour
encounter phases covering the period of several days about the
satellite encounters and Jupiter closest approach was to use the
letter corresponding to the targeted satellite and the orbit number,
e.g., G1, E4, C10, and I24.  Based upon the allocated spacecraft
resources, the specific opportunities presented by each encounter
phase, and the observation strategies described above, the working
groups designed a detailed plan for the mission as described in the
Orbit Activity Plan [GLLOAP].
 
PPR observations in the detailed mission plan used the basic OAPEL
types described above (as well as a few special types added later),
usually in a special PPR Burst-to-Tape record format that stored the
relatively low rate (216 bps) PPR data in spacecraft memory until an
appropriately-sized block of data was accumulated to be written to the
DMS tape.  Other PPR observations were made in the so-called &apos;ride-
along&apos; mode with a record format that included the PPR data as part of
the Low Rate Science along with data from the prime instrument for
that particular OAPEL, nearly always either the Near-Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer (NIMS) or SSI instruments.  For both types of PPR
observations, the original strategy was to use one of three principal
PPR operational modes: (1) cycle mode, for which the PPR filter wheel
makes a complete cycle over a period of about 28 seconds, making
photopolarimetry and thermal radiometry measurements; (2) radiometry
mode, for which the PPR filter wheel cycles back and forth over just
the 7 radiometry positions; and (3) photopolarimetry mode, for which
the PPR filter wheel makes a complete cycle, but steps through the
radiometry positions without taking any data.
 
Midway through the G1 encounter, the PPR instrument exhibited
anomalous behavior with the filter wheel becoming stuck at a single
radiometry position.  As a consequence, all planned PPR OAPELs for G2
were canceled and a sequence involving thermal cycling of the
instrument in an attempt to recover wheel stepping was added at the
end of the G2 encounter.  When that recovery attempt failed, all PPR
OAPELs in C3 and E4 were performed at the single radiometry band at
which the wheel was stuck.  Another recovery sequence at the end of
the E4 sequence proved successful and all PPR observations from then
until the end of the Jupiter Phase Nominal Mission were performed
using an operational mode that allows stepping the wheel back and
forth over a few positions, thus permitting operations without going
back to the position at which the wheel had become stuck.  This same
strategy was followed throughout GEM and GMM, but it was necessary to
have the filter wheel step through the worrisome position on several
occasions in order to start a new cycle.  In each case this operation
was successful and the filter wheel did not become stuck.  Of course,
this means that most PPR OAPELs were then made at fewer wavelengths
than originally planned.  See the INST.CAT file for a detailed
description of the PPR operational modes and the nature of the filter
wheel anomaly.
 
The observations in the present data set are the PPR Reduced Data Record
(RDR) level data for GEM and GMM from E12 encounter through I33
encounter.  The RDR data include PPR science data converted from raw
science data numbers (DN) in the Reformatted Experiment Data Record
(R_EDR) data set (DATA_SET_ID: GO-J-PPR-2-REDR-GEM-GMM-V1.0) to
intensity for the photometry measurements; intensity, linear
polarization degree, and polarization direction for polarimetry; and
radiance in dimensionless DN and corresponding brightness temperature
for the radiometry.  The PPR R_EDR data were organized as records in an
ASCII table, one record for each minor frame buffer of raw PPR data,
with each record containing three pairs of PPR science data samples.
Each record of the RDR data set contains the reduced data for a single
pair of science data samples along with time tag information and some of
the instrument housekeeping from the R_EDR records, again presented in
ASCII tabular format.  Data for each observation, or OAPEL, are
contained in a single data file.  File labels specify the OAPEL, the
time of observation, data file format, and a unique PRODUCT_NAME for the
observation that is generally the same as the Galileo observation ID
with -R_EDR or -RDR appended to indicate reformatted EDR or reduced data
(present data set), respectively.
 
The observation ID is a 12-character field that begins with two
characters for the orbit (e.g., E4, with the letter dropped after
orbit C9), followed by one letter for the target body (J - Jupiter,
C - Callisto, E - Europa, G - Ganymede, I - Io, N - calibration
target, X - space or not applicable), followed by one letter for the
prime instrument for the OAPEL (N - NIMS, P - PPR, S - SSI, U - UVS),
followed by six characters for the observation name (usually the OAPEL
type, but also proper names or abbreviations thereof), followed by a
2-digit observation series number.  Thus, the observation IDs for the
two PPR global maps of Jupiter in orbit G1 are G1JPGLOBAL01 and
G1JPGLOBAL02, while the PPR ride-along with one of the NIMS
observations of a brown barge at 42-degree phase angle in orbit E11 is
11JNBRG04203.  An exception to the leading portion (prior to -RDR) of
the PRODUCT_NAME being identical to the observation ID is that we
retain the leading letter for the orbits after C9.
 
 
Parameters
==========
 
The PPR presents to the Galileo Orbiter Command and Data Subsystem
(CDS), an 18-byte instrument data buffer for each 2/3-sec interval
corresponding to one minor frame (or MOD91) count of the spacecraft
clock (91 minor frames constitute one RIM count of the spacecraft
clock).  For each of the 18-byte PPR minor frame records, the first
six bytes are housekeeping data that completely specify the instrument
status, both commanded parameters and position within operational
measurement mode cycles.  The remaining twelve bytes are three sets of
PPR science data sample pairs and their associated identifying
parameters and parity check bit.
 
Because of the differences in time required for specific steps of the
instrument operation, the various operational modes of the PPR result
in the generation of the 18-byte minor frame records at variable
rates.  Those rates range from just slightly slower than that at which
the CDS performs the readout of those records every 2/3 second to a
rate that is about three times slower.  Accordingly, the PPR design
uses two internal 18-byte buffers that are alternately filled, with
one buffer being active, or in the state of being filled, and the
other containing the previous 18 bytes of housekeeping and science
data for the sequence.  At the time of each CDS readout of PPR data,
it is only the non-active buffer that is presented and placed into the
CDS processing stream, and whenever that buffer has been previously
transferred, the PPR sets a flag in the housekeeping data of that
record to indicate that it is a &apos;repeat&apos; record.  For PPR observations
that use the Low Rate Science format to record to the DMS tape, all
PPR minor frame records are recorded and ultimately returned.  With
the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, however, the CDS checks the PPR
housekeeping to identify and discard the repeat records, storing only
the non-redundant records for playback and downlink telemetry.
 
The PPR R_EDR data set is organized with the PPR minor frame record as
the focus, so each record of the R_EDR ASCII table is a set of columns
that displays all of the housekeeping and science data for that minor
frame along with the spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts that
correspond to the time that the memory buffer containing those data was
readout by the CDS.  In contrast, the focus of the PPR RDR data set is
on the science data unit, with a separate record generated for each of
the three science data sample pairs of the minor frame record.
Moreover, in order to appropriately represent the time at which a
given science sample was acquired, we use the specific timing of the
PPR operational modes to determine an &apos;adjusted&apos; spacecraft clock RIM
and MOD91 count.  The ADJUSTED_RIM and ADJUSTED_MOD91 are the first
two parameters of each RDR record and are followed in the record with
the RIM and MOD91 values to provide an unambiguous identification of
the R_EDR record from which the RDR data came.  Note that the adjusted
RIM and MOD91 naturally always represent earlier times than the RIM
and MOD91 corresponding to the time of the readout of the PPR memory
buffer.  Following the adjusted and original spacecraft clock counts
is the portion of the PPR housekeeping that describes the instrument
status (i.e., not including parity information, valid command count,
repeat memory buffer flag, and memory buffer ID contained in the R_EDR
version archive), the PPR filter wheel position, the raw science data
sample pair in DN, right ascension and declination (in degrees) of the
scan platform instruments boresight direction, radiometry radiance in
DN, radiometry brightness temperature in Kelvins, photometry or
polarimetry radiance in DN, photometry or polarimetry radiance in
absolute units of watts per square cm per steradian per nm, linear
polarization degree in percent, polarization direction angle in
degrees (i.e., the direction of the maximum E-field vector in the
scene radiance relative to the PPR reference plane defined by the
instrument baseplate), and a flag indicating whether the data sample
pair was corrupted by a spacecraft boom passing through the PPR FOV.
 
 
Processing
==========
 
The PPR makes three different types of measurements: photometry,
polarimetry, and radiometry, with a range of positions on the rotating
PPR filter wheel corresponding to each.  Positions 0 - 17 are used for
three polarimetry spectral bands, 18 - 24 for seven thermal radiometry
bands, and 25 - 31 for seven photometry bands.  At each of the thermal
radiometry positions, a chopper mirror alternately directs the scene
flux and the space-view reference flux through the filter and then
from a mirror mounted on the back of the filter wheel to a
pyroelectric detector.  For radiometry measurements, the first of the
pair of data samples is the digitized output from the detector while
the second data sample is the reading from one of 10 thermistors
monitoring the temperature of internal instrument elements or 2
platinum resistance thermometers and a reference resistance monitoring
the temperature of the PPR radiometric calibration target (RCT).  At
the photometry and polarimetry positions, the scene flux is directed
by a relay lens through a Wollaston prism that splits the input into
two orthogonally-polarized output beams, which are then focused onto a
pair of silicon photodiode detectors.  Polarimetry measurements for a
given spectral band are made at three filter wheel positions with
three different orientations of half-wave retarders (mounted over the
filter positions) in order to obtain the linear polarization degree
and direction as well as intensity, whereas for photometry, the two
orthogonal intensity components are simply added to get the intensity.
 
The data reduction of the thermal radiometry entails the correction of
the raw pyroelectric detector output for contributions to the measured
flux by emission, albeit small, from internal elements such as mirrors
and radiometric stops.  These corrections use the element temperatures
monitored by the thermistors along with calibration factors determined
through ground thermal vacuum tests in which each element was in turn
heated by several degrees to observe the sensitivity to that
particular element.  The corrected net thermal radiance is then
converted to a brightness temperature in Kelvins.
 
Input data for the RDR data set are of course the R_EDR data, with
three RDR records generated for each R_EDR record, corresponding to
one RDR record for each of the three science data sample pairs in the
R_EDR record, as described above.  Each RDR data set record identifies
the filter wheel position for that particular science data sample
pair, which in turn indicates whether that record corresponds to
radiometry, photometry, or polarimetry.  Thus, meaningful reduced
values for the respective type of PPR measurement appear in the
appropriate columns and zero-fill is used in the other columns; e.g.,
when the filter wheel is at position 21, there are entries for the
radiometry radiance in DN and the brightness temperature, but the
polarimetry/photometry intensities, linear polarization degree, and
polarization directions are set to zero.  Since polarimetry requires a
minimum of two, and preferably three successive retarder positions,
the tabulated polarization quantities are based upon the current data
sample position and the previous, most recent data for the other
requisite position(s).
 
 
Data
====
 
The PPR reduced data are formatted as ASCII tables, one record for
each PPR data sample pair corresponding to a single measurement.  Each
record begins with the adjusted spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts
that correspond to the time at which the sample was acquired and these
are followed by the original RIM and MOD91 that provide the time tag
identifying the R_EDR record that serves as the input for these RDR
records.
 
For PPR observations that use the Burst-to-Tape record mode, the
spacecraft scan platform pointing (viz., right ascension and
declination angles) information is merged with the PPR science data
because the Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) readouts
that are included in the Low Rate Science record blocks and provide
scan platform pointing would not otherwise be available with adequate
frequency in the playback and downlink of the Burst-to-Tape mode.  So
the two columns of the RDR records for the scan platform right
ascension and declination angles, are set to zero when the PPR
observation uses the Low Rate Science record mode.  In all record
formats other than PPR Burst-to-Tape, the AACS information is
delivered directly to the SPICE System, which provides general target
and observing geometry and is archived in PDS.  For the Burst-to-Tape
record mode, the scan platform right ascension and declination are
obtained from the PPR science data and then delivered to the SPICE
System.
 
Note also that in the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, the second byte
of the PPR housekeeping is deleted from the data stored in the CDS
memory buffer in order to reduce the total data volume slightly and to
optimize the sizing of the buffer.  The second byte of housekeeping
was chosen because the bits therein correspond to the values for three
parameters: photopolarimetry gain, radiometry gain, and number of
samples, and all three of these parameters are set by command and do
not change during instrument operation unless reset by sending a new
command.  See the data label file format for a detailed description of
these parameters.  In the processing to generate the present reduced
science data, the known values for these parameters are manually
input based upon the Galileo Sequence of Events File (SEF), which
indicates the timing of the PPR commands and the commanded parameter
values.
 
Listed below by orbit are the PPR RDR data files with the data
filename, observation ID (modified as described above), observation
start time, and duration.  Files are located in subdirectories by orbit
name and then by target.  Please note that because of the anomalous
behavior of the PPR radiometry in encounter C20, reduction of those
radiometry observations would be meaningless.  Since all observations
planned for C20 were in radiometry mode, none of the C20 observations
represented in the R_EDR data set are included here.

Ancillary Data
==============
 
The housekeeping and science data in the full PPR minor frame records
contain all of the commanded parameters and all variable parameter
values that completely specify the instrument status, including the
position within various measurement mode cycles.  When observations
are made using the PPR Burst-to-Tape record mode, the second byte of
the PPR housekeeping is deleted before the data are stored in the CDS
memory buffer.  This byte contains the commanded values for the
photopolarimetry gain, radiometry gain, and number of successive
samples to be taken at each filter wheel position before stepping to
the next position.  These three parameters are set by command and do
not change during instrument operation unless reset by a new command.
Actual values can be obtained from the Galileo Sequence of Events File
(SEF), which is archived in the PDS by the Galileo Project and which
indicates timing of the PPR commands and the commanded parameter
values.  In processing to generate the present reduced science data,
the SEF or equivalent PPR-team-maintained command records are used to
manually input the actual values for these three parameters.
 
The target body for each observation is indicated in the observation
ID and in the label file for each data file.  Observed location on the
target body and observing geometry (viz., target range and incidence,
emission, and phase angles) for each measurement sample within an
observation sequence must be obtained from the SPICE system for the
spacecraft clock time corresponding to the measurement.  Note that the
spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts for each record of the R_EDR
data set correspond to the time that the respective PPR memory buffer
was readout by the CDS.  The actual time at which the measurement
samples were acquired is earlier than that time by varying amounts
depending on instrument operation mode and the position of the data
sample in the PPR buffer.  In the processing to generate the present
reduced science data, the appropriate adjusted spacecraft clock time
is determined and represented as adjusted RIM and MOD91 counts, which
are the first two entries in each RDR data set record.  The SPICE data
(kernels) and system tools are archived in PDS by the Galileo Project.
The present reduced science data set includes geometric information
(observed location on target body, observing geometry, range, etc.) as
determined by the PPR team using the SPICE system.  Subdirectory GEOMETRY
on this volume contains a *.GEO file with that information for each
*.TAB reduced science data file.
 
Calibration coefficients to convert PPR photometry and polarimetry
measurements of intensity from DN values at a particular instrument
gain level to absolute units are based upon ground calibration
measurements.  Thermal radiometry measurement conversion to brightness
temperature is a substantially more complex reduction process based
upon various calibration tests performed before launch, but was always
expected to require significant iteration based upon in-flight
observations of the PPR radiometric calibration target (RCT), whose
temperature is monitored and readout in the PPR science data stream.
The ancillary data in CALINFO.TXT provides the photometry and
polarimetry calibration coefficients and tabulates the results of the
in-flight RCT observations.
 
 
Coordinate System
=================
 
For PPR observations that use the Burst-to-Tape record mode, the right
ascension and declination angles of the scan platform instrument
boresight direction are merged with the PPR housekeeping and science
data and appear as two columns of each RDR data set record.  All other
record modes include the scan platform pointing in the AACS section of
the Low Rate Science blocks, so it is necessary to use the SPICE
system to obtain these angles for those observations.  The SPICE
system kernels contain Galileo spacecraft ephemeris, scan platform
pointing, and instrument data necessary for providing target body
coordinates and observing geometry as a function of time, using IAU
standard coordinate systems as specified in the SPICE documentation.
As indicated above, geometry information generated by the PPR science
team using the SPICE system is provided in files contained in the GEOMETRY
subdirectory of this volume.
 
The reduced PPR polarimetry observations provide the radiance, or
intensity, the linear polarization degree, and the direction of the
polarization of the light scattered-reflected from the viewed target.
Polarization direction is the plane in which the maximum electric
field vector of the incident flux lies and in the present RDR data
is referenced to the PPR instrument baseplate. In the case of a
photon scattered or reflected just once, i.e., single scattering,
the polarization direction must lie precisely either in the
scattering plane or perpendicular to it, where the scattering plane
is the plane defined by the vector between the Sun and the observed
point and the vector from the spacecraft to the observed point. Even
in the more general multiple scattering case, the polarization
direction is rarely more than a few degrees away from being either
parallel or perpendicular to the scattering plane unless the linear
polarization is close to zero, where the direction of course becomes
undefined. As a consequence, polarimetry data will typically show
polarization direction angles clustered, either about a single angle
or two angles separated by about 90 degrees. Because of this
approximate discrete two-valued nature rather than continuous over
the full range of angles, linear polarization is often presented as
a signed value, with negative values corresponding to the situation
where the direction lies in or very near the scattering plane.
 
The twist angle for the scan platform is the third Euler angle
of the three that represent the C-matrix:
 
   CMAT = [twist]  [pi/2 - DEC]  [RA]
                 3             2     3
 
The SPICE routine M2EUL can be used to recover Euler angles from
a C-matrix.

Confidence Level Overview
=========================
 
The PPR RDR data set represents all PPR data for the Jupiter Phase
Nominal Mission and GEM and GMM extended tours as recovered from the
Galileo Project ground system, with the exception of the observations
during the C20 encounter that would be meaningless owing to the
anomalous PPR radiometry mode behavior.  When multiple passes of the
DMS tape were downlinked, the data were merged to provide the most
complete sequences.
 
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
 
The RDR data set is organized into a separate file for each PPR
observation or OAPEL as listed in the Data section under DATA_SET_DESC
above.  The start times and durations in that set of lists correspond
to the actual times of the first and last records returned for the
particular OAPEL rather than the planned times, if different.  In a
few cases, the data begin later or end earlier than planned owing to
limitations on DMS tape or bits-to-ground capability or losses during
downlink and ground processing.  There are, in addition, a few OAPELs
that have coverage gaps.
 
Parity bits generated by the PPR instrument processor and placed in
the PPR housekeeping and science data were monitored in the processing
of the EDR data and indicate that there appear to be no instances of
individual bit changes in the data stream.  For PPR observations that
use a DMS tape record mode employing the Low Rate Science format, any
data gaps caused by telemetry dropouts appear as a loss of entire PPR
minor frame records.  In contrast, for the Burst-to-Tape record mode,
the channelization procedure used in storing the PPR data stream in
the CDS memory buffer can lead to the return of PPR minor frame
records with missing bytes in which zero-fill is used by the ground
system.  The PPR science data samples use a non-zero &apos;dark&apos; level
offset larger than any expected noise.  Thus, zero is not a legitimate
value for these samples, for which the PPR processor uses a twos-
compliment mode that when converted from the raw data stream to the
RDR format for the basic data samples in DN will appear as 4095 if
zero-fill has occurred.
 
As described earlier, data reduction of the thermal radiometry entails
the correction of the raw pyroelectric detector output for
contributions to the measured flux by emission, albeit small, from
internal elements such as mirrors and radiometric stops.  These
corrections use the element temperatures monitored by the thermistors
along with calibration factors determined through ground thermal
vacuum tests in which each element was in turn heated by several
degrees to observe the sensitivity to that particular element.  The
corrected net thermal radiance is then converted to a brightness
temperature in Kelvins.  In-flight observations of the PPR radiometric
calibration target (RCT), whose temperature is monitored and readout
in the PPR science data stream, reveal that the coefficients used in
the basic reduction to date require re-examination because the
agreement between the reduced brightness temperature of the RCT and
the measured value is variable, with the former generally too low, in
some cases by as much as 7.0 degrees.  During GEM and GMM phases,
the sign of the difference was less systematic, perhaps owing to much
increased noise levels, especially for those orbits with the high
radiation environment closer to Jupiter.  The ancillary data set,
CALINFO.TXT, tabulates the results of the in-flight RCT observations.
 
Noise in the PPR radiometry measurements is due to inherent instrument
noise caused by the response of the pyroelectric detector to small
fluctuations of the thermal state in the region of the detector and
noise caused by high-energy radiation (presumably particles) impacting
the detector. The former, which we shall call instrument noise, is of
order 1-2 DN at radiometry gain level 2 for the typical instrument
operating temperature of -20 to -15 degrees Celsius. Radiation noise
is assumed to be the perturbation in the pyroelectric detector output
caused by the very short interaction of the high-energy particle with
the detector and can be either a positive or negative change depending
on the part of the chopper cycle during which it occurs, i.e., whether
scene or space is being viewed. Of course, the contribution due to
radiation noise is quite variable, with generally increased noise with
decreasing distance of the spacecraft from Jupiter. During the mission
phase through E11, radiation noise at gain level 2 was typically 2-10
DN, but it occasionally hit higher peak levels.  Throughout the GEM
and GMM phases, the radiation noise was generally higher, with typical
values as large as 20-30 DN in some cases.  At a gain level 2 for
observed brightness temperatures of order 130 K, a 2 DN change in the
radiometry measurement corresponds to a brightness temperature change
of about 1-2 K depending on the band. As a consequence, most PPR
observations were designed to permit averaging of at least four
successive samples without degrading spatial resolution. However, even
with averaging, noise remains a problem in many cases and one should
use caution with respect to both the absolute accuracy and the
precision of the PPR radiometry data.
 
 
Limitations
===========
 
As described in the Data Set Overview section of DATA_SET_DESC above,
the PPR instrument exhibited anomalous behavior with the filter wheel
becoming stuck at a single radiometry position midway through the G1
encounter.  While a recovery sequence involving thermal cycling of the
instrument succeeded at the end of the E4 encounter, an operational
mode different from that originally planned was then used during the
remainder of the Jupiter Phase Nominal Mission and the GEM and GMM
extended tours to avoid having to step through the position at which
the filter wheel stuck more than on a limited number of occasions.
As a consequence, many planned OAPELs were used with a somewhat
different science strategy than that originally intended and some
OAPEL names may seem slightly inconsistent with the actual observation.
It should be noted that during encounter C20, the PPR exhibited quite
anomalous behavior in radiometry measurements.  All of the radiometry
data samples were clustered at a DN value of 1412, slightly above the
typical dark-level offset, and showed an extremely small scatter well
below the typical noise level.  This behavior was interpreted as being
consistent with a failed radiometry detector or pre-amplifier.  A PPR
heating sequence was thus scheduled early in encounter C21 based upon
the hope that one possible cause, debonding in the detector, might be
at least partially reversed by high temperatures.  Data playback from
C21 (and all subsequent encounters) showed that the radiometry function
had essentially recovered to nominal performance.
 
As noted earlier, the spacecraft clock RIM and MOD91 counts for each
record of the R_EDR data set correspond to the time that the
respective PPR memory buffer was readout by the CDS. The actual time
at which the measurement samples were acquired is earlier than that
time by varying amounts depending on instrument operation mode and
the position of the data sample in the PPR buffer. In the processing
to generate the present reduced science data, an appropriate adjusted
spacecraft clock time is determined and represented as adjusted RIM
and MOD91 counts, which are the first two entries in each RDR data
set record. The most precise such time adjustment would require
knowledge not only of the known sampling times for each portion of
a cycle, but also the exact phase of the cycle with respect to the
minor frame, or MOD91 period. Since that phase is dependent upon the
precise timing of PPR power on and commanded mode changes, it would
have to be determined empirically from the detailed pattern of PPR
buffer redundancies, which is in fact not feasible for short data
spans. Accordingly, the time adjustment is made without taking
account of the phase, with the consequence that the adjusted times
may be in error by as much as one minor frame period of two-thirds
of a second.
