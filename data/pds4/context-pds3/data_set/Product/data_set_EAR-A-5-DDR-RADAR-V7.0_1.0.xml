  Data Set Overview
  =================
  This data set is intended to include all groundbased asteroid radar
  detections.  These entries were collected by Steven J. Ostro, and
  selected data have been provided as collected from the published
  literature.  Scientific questions about this data set should be
  directed to Steven J. Ostro, JPL, at the email address
  ostro@echo.jpl.nasa.gov.  (Effective date for this address:
  March 23, 1999.)
 
  Modification History
  ====================
  The radar data set was first introduced into PDS at the April 1994
  asteroid data sets review, and has been updated yearly since that
  time.  Updates consist in adding entries for asteroid radar
  detections made since the previous update and adding full data for
  detections which have been published since the last update.  The 1997
  update added radar albedos, and these have continued to be added in
  subsequent updates.
 
  Parameters
  ==========
  An entry for each detection reports radar cross-section, circular
  polarization and radar albedo, if known, error values for these
  parameters, year of observation, and the reference in which the
  observations were reported.
 
  Data
  ====
  This data set comprises a single data table, &apos;radar.tab&apos;, tabulating
  the parameters listed above.
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
  The references of the papers in which the asteroid radar detections
  were reported are compiled in the file &apos;radarref.tab&apos;.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
  The confidence level of each data value reported is reflected in the
  uncertainty value in the same entry.  Further information about the
  observations can be obtained by consulting the original reference for
  each entry.
 
  Review
  ======
  This data set underwent external peer review on June 1, 2000.
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
  This data set is intended to include all groundbased radar detections
  of asteroids.  It is complete through January 2000.
  If an item of data is missing from the table (appearing as a null
  value such as 9.99), this indicates that the data item is not
  available from the published paper.  For example, for monostatic
  radar observations, circular polarization ratio cannot be derived,
  so it is left blank.  In some cases, the data provided in the paper
  are too complex to be presented in the table, as in the case of a
  time-series of values.  In case of questions, the original papers
  should be consulted.
 
  Limitations
  ===========
  This data set is intended to collect the data reported in the
  published literature, as well as to record the existence of
  unpublished asteroid radar detections.
