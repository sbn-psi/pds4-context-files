    Data Set Overview
    =================
      Description of the PDS LECP Neptune Step data.
 
      This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy
      Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft
      for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet
      Neptune.  The period covered is 1989/day 236/0000 SCET to
      1989/day 239/0000 SCET.  This data gives scan plane angle
      distributions for those periods when the LECP instrument was
      mechanically scanning.  There are periods when the instrument
      was not scanning, and the corresponding data does not appear
      here with this Step data.  Another data set that is available,
      the so called Scan data, contains data for these not stepping
      periods as well as angle averaged data for the stepping
      periods.  The instrument samples 8 directional sectors during a
      single scan, and thus this Step data contains 8 particle
      intensity numbers for each channel of data utilized (a ninth
      sector corresponds to accummulations for which the sector is
      unknown).
 
      Three scanning situations occurred during the time of this
      data.  They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for
      each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;
      note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), 2) a special
      Neptune scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, 1,
      scan, 7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 and the 1 represent
      5.2 minute periods when the instrument is fixed in sectors 7 or
      1, respectively, and where the word scan represents a period of
      scanning (6 sec stepping for a total scan time of 48 sec); and
      3) periods when the detectors are fixed for more extended
      periods in sector 7 (periods bracketing the ring plane
      crossings).  For this Neptune Step data, the 6.4 minute full
      scan records during stepping mode (1) have been time averaged
      to 12.8 minute records.  Also, during stepping mode (2), the
      double scans that have no fixed periods between them have been
      averaged together into a single (96 sec) record.  The single
      scans represent 48 sec records.  The schedule for the three
      stepping modes is as follows:
 
           prior to day 236/1600 SCET:     Mode (1)
           236/1600 to 237/0239:           Mode (2)
           237/0239 to 237/0319:           Mode (3)
           237/0319 to 237/0503:           Mode (2)
           237/0503 to 237/0554:           Mode (3)
           237/0554 to 238/0400:           Mode (2)
           after 237/0400:                 Mode (1)
 
      Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample
      switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data
      a disjointed appearence.
 
      The LECP channels utilized with this data set are:
 
      EB01:          electrons,  22 to  35 keV
      EB02:          electrons,  35 to  61 keV
      EB03:          electrons,  61 to 112 keV
      EB04:          electrons, 112 to 183 keV
      EG06-EG07:     electrons, 252 to 480 keV
      EG07-EG08:     electrons, 480 to 853 keV
      EG08-EG09:     electrons, 853 to 1200 keV
      PL01:          ions,       28 to  43  keV
      PL02:          ions,       43 to  80  keV
      PL03:          ions,       80 to 137  keV
      PL04:          ions,      137 to 215  keV
      PL05:          ions,      215 to 540  keV
      PL06:          ions,      540 to 990  keV
      PL07:          ions,      990 to 2140 keV
      PL08:          ions,     2140 to 3500 keV
 
      Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from 4
      of the instrumental channels by taking differences between
      adjacent (in energy) channels.
 
      The channel data is given in units of intensity:
      counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed
      that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from
      the raw count rates via the relation:
 
                        I = CR/(eG.(E2-E1),
 
      where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and
      (E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton
      values of these parameters were used in deriving the
      intensities for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under
      the assumption that some other mass species dominates, one must
      convert back to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton paramters,
      and then convert to intensity using the parameters
      corresponding to the mass species in question.  The parameters
      can be found in Table 1 of Krimigis et al.  (Journal of
      Geophysical Research, V.  86, page 8227, 1981) The
      corresponding parameters for electrons can be found in Mauk et
      al.  (Journal of Geophysical Research, V.  92, page 15283,
      1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity, the count rates
      have been corrected for: (1) Background, (2) electron
      contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and (3) solar
      UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.
 
      The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with
      each channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the two
      quantities: (i) one standard deviation Poisson statistical
      error, and (ii) a percentage assigned by the data supplier
      based on the amount of contamination correction that has been
      performed on each data channel.
 
      Also supplied with each record of this data set is the fraction
      of the data accummulations that correspond to each of the 8
      angle sectors.  A sector 9 has also been defined corresponding
      to those accumulations with no known sector assignment.
 
      Additionally supplied for each data channel a one bit code that
      tells whether that channel had any accumulations at all
      associated with it (1 = yes; 0 = no).  This code must be used
      to distinquish between accumulations that yielded no counts and
      situations where the channel simply had no accumulations
      (results in Intensity = 0.0).

        The channel data is given in units of intensity:
        counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed
        that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from
        the raw count rates via the relation:
 
                          I = CR/(eG.(E2-E1),
 
        where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and
        (E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The
        proton values of these parameters were used in deriving the
        intensities for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities
        under the assumption that some other mass species dominates,
        one must convert back to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton
        paramters, and then convert to intensity using the parameters

        Mauk et al.  (Journal of Geophysical Research, V.  92, page

    Overview
    ========
      Confidence note for the PDS Neptune LECP Step data.
 
      High quality data is available from the LECP instrument
      throughout the time period addressed with this data set.  The
      data is subject to errors associated with Poisson statistics
      and associated with various kinds and levels of contamination.
      The known contaminations are: i) penetrating backgound, ii)
      Solar UV contamination within the lowest energy ion channel
      when the detector faces sunward, and iii) electron
      contamination of the lower energy ion channels (the
      contaminating electrons are measured).  Corrections have been
      made to the data in attemps to remove the effects of these
      contaminations.
 
      An error parameter is given for each particle intensity value
      given in the data set.  This error is expressed as a
      percentage.  This number is the larger of the following items:
      1) the one standard deviation Poisson error, and 2) a value
      assigned by the data supplier associated with the degree of
      correction that was required with regard to the contaminations
      listed above.
 
      Missing data is indicated with a binary flag associated with
      each energy channel.  Each channel&apos;s flag will read 1 if at
      least one instrumental accumulation occurred for that channel
      and for that record.  The flag reads 0 for no accumulations.
      This parameter must be utilized to distinguish between
      accumulations that yielded no counts, and the situation where
      there simply were no accummulations (the error parameter reads
      100 for both cases).
