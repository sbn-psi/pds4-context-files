    Data Set Overview
    =================
    This data set includes the ECAS system (Eight Color Asteroid Survey)
    photometry and taxonomic types of 77 Near Earth Objects published by
    R.J. Whiteley in his thesis (Whiteley, 2001.  A compositional and
    dynamical survey of the near-earth asteroids. Ph.D. thesis, University
    of Hawaii).  [WHITELEY2001] The ECAS system is established in Zellner
    et al. 1985, Icarus 61, 355-416 [ZELLNERETAL1985].  The original ECAS
    survey is available in PDS as data set EAR-A-2CP-3-RDR-ECAS-V3.0.  The
    data presented here are new measurements based on the ECAS system.
 
    Data
    ====
    Data include five ECAS colors, with errors, for each of the 77 NEOs.
    Also included is the taxonomic type for each object, generated from the
    presented ECAS colors using principal component analysis.  Since the
    details of the observations are published in a thesis, which may not be
    accessible to all users, some details of the observations are included
    here.
 
    Observations were obtained at the University of Hawaii 2.24m
    telescope between August 1996 and March 2000.  All observations were
    conducted at the rate of motion of the targets, and most observations
    were conducted between 1.0 and 1.8 airmasses.
 
    The typical observing sequence for an asteroid was to observe in
    sequence through the bwxpu filters, interspersing observations through
    the v filter every 5 to 10 minutes.  The result was a series of 16 to
    20 photometric observations, 2 each through the bwxpu filters, and 6 to
    10 observations through the v filter. The repeated observations through
    the v filter allowed modelling to minimize the effects of the
    asteroid&apos;s lightcurve.
 
    Each of the six filters was calibrated by observing the standard
    stars defined for and used during the ECAS survey.  Adequate
    calibration data were taken so that each individual night&apos;s data could
    be independently calibrated, although in practice the calibration
    coefficients were stable over the course of a 2 or 3 night run.
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
    The ECAS filter bandpasses and response curves have been included in
    this data set.  These files are identical to the filter bandpass and
    response curve files in the ECAS data set (PDS data set ID EAR-A-2CP-3-
    RDR-ECAS-V3.0).
