  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The data set consists of ground-based images of comet 9P/Tempel 1 in the R
    and HB filters taken at the Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope between February and
    June 2005 prior to the Deep Impact encounter. The Kitt Peak 2.1m telescope
    at f/7.5 with the F3KB (3kx1k) chip was used for all observations. Harris
    broad band filters optimized for the Landolt broad band colors were used
    as well as narrowband HB filters. The comet was tracked at non-sidereal
    rates.
 
    Raw, as well as reduced images are included. Corresponding calibration
    frames (dome flats, bias frames, and dark frames) are included.
    All the data were bias subtracted and flat fielded with the dome flats and
    some of the data were dark corrected. The F3KB has some LED effects in the
    corners of the CCD.
 
    The KPNO observing logs as well as additional handwritten logs  are also
    included in pdf format. The KPNO observing logs are named kp05mmdd_log.pdf
    where mmdd are the numerical month and day of the observing log. The
    handwritten logs are named 2005_Mon_dd.pdf where Mon the 3-letter
    abbreviation of the month and dd the  day of the observing log.
 
    The observing dates in 2005 were:
    February 2-5, March 11-14, April 9-14, May 14-17, and June 4-7.
    The following nights were photometric:
    February 2 &amp; 3 (but see note below), March 11-13, April 10, 11, &amp; 14, May
    14 &amp; 16, and June 5-7.
 
    NOTE that all the data from the February run were affected by a sticky
    shutter. We therefore could not flux calibrate those data, although the
    standard star images are still included in the data set.
 
    Landolt standard fields are available in photometric nights. Often frames
    of fields where the comet was/will be located from previous/subsequent
    nights were also taken in order to tie non-photometric nights to
    photometric nights. Such images are also included.
 
    Tables listing the centers (x,y) of the Landolt standard stars and the
    object in the reduced images are also included. NOTE that the origin of
    the coordinate system is (1,1). The centers for the HB standard stars are
    not included as they are very bright stars and are almost always the only
    object in the frame. They were always placed near the center of the CCD
    and are easy to identify.
 
 
    For the photometric nights, tables relating the counts of individual
    images to calibrated flux units for the broadband R as well as the HB
    comet filters are also included.
 
    f(X) = counts/sec * f0(X) * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP(X)-coeff(X)*airmass))
 
    where m0=25mag is the zero point offset of the magnitude scale, ZP(X) the
    zero point, coeff(X) the airmass coefficient, and counts/sec is the DN
    value read from the image / exposure time.
 
    Therefore
 
    f(X) = DN value * f0(X) * conversion factor
 
    where the conversion factor is
     1/exptime * 10^(-0.4*(m0-ZP(X)-coeff(X)*air1mass))
 
    These conversion factors are given in tables.
    For the broadband R filter (X=R) and
    f0(R)=2.23E-09 erg s^-1 cm^-2 Angstrom^-1 (converted from Bessel 1979).
    The error in f0(R) is 0.02E-09 due to the difference in effective
    wavelength between the Cousins Filter and the Harris filter. The filter
    response curves however look very similar to each other.
 
    For the narrowband HB filters,  the values for f0(X) in 1E-9 erg s^-1
    cm^-2 Angstrom^-1 (Farnham et al. 2000) are:
    f0(OH)=10.560
    f0(CN)=8.6
    f0(C2)=3.887
    f0(UC)=7.802
    f0(BC)=6.210
    f0(GC)=3.616
    f0(RC)=1.316
 
 
    Some of the comet data were affected by obvious guiding problems (which
    are not always noted in the logs). Some of these images were still
    archived but were not flux calibrated. If images are not in the archive
    (but are mentioned in the log files), then there was something wrong with
    them (e.g. obvious guiding errors, wrong field,
    saturated standards, etc.). Conversion factors of images that could not be
    flux calibrated in photometric nights (due to various problems) are not
    included in the conversion files.
 
    The fits headers often show the filter number but not the filter name. The
    following table shows the correspondence of the filter number to the
    filter name. This is valid for all the observing runs.
 
    Filter number       Filter name       Description
    1                      OH               HB OH
    2                      UC               HB UV continuum
    3                      CN               HB CN
    4                      BC               HB blue continuum
    5                      C2               HB C2
    6                      GC               HB green continuum
    7                      RC               HB red continuum
    8                      R                broad-band R
 
 
    Directory Structure:
    The data were archived into raw and reduced directories for the raw and
    reduced data respectively. Each of these directories have sub-directories
    with the data in the form of 2005_monthdd where month is
    feb, march, april, may, or june, and dd the day.
    These sub-directories contain the tables listing the centers and the
    conversion tables, and are divided further into subdirectories called
    calibrations, calibration_fields, comet_9p_tempel_1, and standard_stars.
    Not all of these sub-directories are present in every directory. The
    &apos;calibrations&apos; directory contains bias, flat, and dark frames. The
    &apos;calibration_fields&apos; directory contains frames
    where the comet was/will be located from previous/subsequent nights. The
    &apos;comet_9p_tempel_1&apos; directory contains images of comet 9P/Tempel 1. The
    &apos;standard_stars&apos; directory contains images of the standard stars. All the
    image names are of the following convention;
    kp05mmdd_nnn.fit, where dd is the 2-digit month, dd the 2-digit day and
    nnn a sequential integer number starting at 001.
 
 
    Preliminary results from this data set were reported at the DPS meeting
    (Farnham 2005). Some results from this data set were included in the
    overview paper by Meech et al. (2010). Farnham et al. (2007) reported on
    observations of comet C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) taken during the same observing
    runs as the Tempel 1 data. Users of this archive might find it useful for
    background information and more details about the telescope/instrument
    used.
 
    The archiving of these data set was supported by NASA&apos;s Planetary Mission
    Data Analysis Program.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data from the February run are affected by a sticky shutter. These
    data therefore cold not be flux calibrated.
 
    Some of the comet data were affected by guiding problems. The images were
    still archived but are not flux calibrated.
 
    The conversion factors to relate counts to flux densities have an error of
    about 2%.
