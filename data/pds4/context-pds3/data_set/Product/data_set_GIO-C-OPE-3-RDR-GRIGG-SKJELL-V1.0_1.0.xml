      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This dataset includes raw and calibrated results from the Optical
      Probe Experiment (OPE) aboard the Giotto spacecraft during its extended
      mission to comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup, as well as the data used in the
      calibration.
 
           Description of the instrument by A. C. Levasseur-Regourd:
 
           &apos;The OPE polarimeter was designed to measure the polarized
        components of the light in seven bandpasses or channels, ranging
        from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Three channels (so-
        called blue, green and red) were devoted to the observation of the
        scattering of solar light by cometary dust grains, in emission-free
        countinuum bands. Four other channels (so called OH, CN, CO+, C2)
        were devoted to the observation of light emitted by cometary
        gases.
 
           &apos;The imaging of a mosaic of interference filters (placed in front
        of the objective lens and organized into a mosaic to compensate for
        the chromatic effects) onto a microchannel plate allowed the
        spectral discrimination to be achieved. A polaroid analyzer, placed
        in front of each filter, except the CO+ one, allowed the polarization
        to be determined by the rotation of the analyzer with the spin of
        the spacecraft. During a spin period (of approximately 4 seconds),
        eight consecutive measurements of the polarized intensity, Ii, Ii+1,
        Ii+2, etc, (of approximately half a second each), were performed in
        the seven channels at eight so-called clock angles.&apos;
 
      Parameters
      ==========
      The principal parameter in each dataset is counts in each channel.
      The raw data file contains a time-ordered list of counts in all
      instrument channels.  Two separate files provide calibrated results
      in two of the bands (blue and green continuum), listed with respect to
      distance along the track of the spacecraft.  This distance has its zero
      point at the nominal time of closest approach near 15:30:45.
 
      Data
      ====
      There are four separate data files:
 
          operaw    Raw, decommuted counts in chronological order
          opeblue   Calibrated counts as a function of distance,
                    blue continuum
          opegreen  Calibrated counts as a function of distance,
                    green continuum
          opecal    Calibration data for both blue and green filters

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      See the accopmanying documentation (opechan.doc) file for a discussion
      of the sensitivity and residual effects on the OPE instrument from the
      preceding encounter with comet 1P/Halley.
 
      Review
      ======
      This data set never underwent formal PDS review.
