  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains the polarimetry of asteroid 25143 Itokawa
    published in Cellino et al. (2005).  The observations were made
    from  June 26 through July 3, 2004 with the Torino
    photopolarimeter at the 2.15 m telescope of the El Leoncito
    Observatory in Argentina.  On June 26 and July 1 and 2, weather
    prevented any useful observations of Itokawa, so the data
    presented here are from the other nights of the run.  The degree
    of linear polarization in five filters (Johnson-Cousins UBVRI) was
    measured over a wide range of phase angles, between 40 and 80
    degrees.  The data obtained are sufficient to derive an estimate
    of the asteroid&apos;s geometric albedo of 0.24 +/- 0.01.
 
    The single entries in the table correspond to averages over time
    spans of about one hour each. Some averaging was done because in
    polarimetry single measurements have usually fairly large error
    bars.  During one hour the phase angle did not change by more than
    one degree, as can be seen from the difference in the phase angle
    listed in each entry of the table for the same night.
 
    Single polarization measurements consisted of eight photometric
    measurements corresponding to a cycle of eight different positions
    of the half-wave plate in front of the polarimeter. A single cycle
    takes about 3.5 minutes. For Itokawa it was decided that the usual
    procedure of computing the average nightly polarization, by making
    an average over all the single measurements taken during the
    night, was clearly not appropriate.  The reason for not doing so
    was that the object was moving fast and the phase angle was
    changing. On the other hand, the phase change was fairly small
    over intervals of some tens of minutes.
 
    The average over the cycles continuously executed during time
    spans of about one hour was adopted as a compromise between the
    need of documenting the change in polarization for changing phase
    angle, and the need of having fairly good error bars in the
    corresponding polarization measurements.
 
    25143 Itokawa is an S-type asteroid, an NEO, and was the target of
    the Hayabusa mission.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Uncertainties for the measurements are given in the table.  Note
    that albedo was determined by linear extrapolation of the
    polarization obtained within the phase angles 40-80 degrees,
    rather than near the inversion point (20-30 degrees).  For further
    information about the measurements and analysis, see Cellino et
    al. (2005).
