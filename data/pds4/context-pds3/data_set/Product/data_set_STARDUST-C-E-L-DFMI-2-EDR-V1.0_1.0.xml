     Stardust Dust Flux Monitor Instrument Data Description:
     =======================================================
 
 
     Data Set Overview:
     =================
 
     This volume contains dust events collected during the early cruise
     phase by the Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) flown onboard
     the STARDUST satellite.  The data in this archive are organized
     into two ASCII tables, using the same record layout.  The first
     table, dfmicru001.tab, provides data readout at the &apos;&apos;CRUISE&apos;&apos; rate
     (as often as 10 Hz but as infrequently as every 20 minutes).  The
     second table, dfmienc001.tab, provides test data readout at the
     &apos;&apos;ENCOUNTER&apos;&apos; rate (as often as 10 Hz but at least every second).
 
 
     Instrument Description:
     =======================
 
     The Dust Flux Monitor Instrument (DFMI) will carry out
     quantitative measurements of particle impact rate and particle
     mass distribution throughout the flyby of Comet Wild-2.  There
     are two PVDF sensor units, each measuring different mass
     densities, as well as two acoustic sensors.  Please refer to
     both the DFMI Calibration report and the papers provided in the
     /EXTRAS directory on this archive.
 
 
     General notes regarding fields of the data tables:
     ==================================================
 
        * Strings appear in quotes.
        * Integers and PDS times do not require quotes.
        * If a field is unknown, UNK may be entered.
        * If a field is not applicable, N/A may be entered.
 
 
     Definition of the fields in the data tables:
     ============================================
 
        EVENT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER:     The number associated with an
                                   event in the file DFMICRU001.TAB,
                                   with 1 being the first event
                                   recorded and n being the n&apos;th
                                   event recorded.
 
        SPACECRAFT_UTC_TIME:       The time at which data was
                                   obtained in UTC.
 
        SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_TIME:     The time at which data was obtained
                                   in seconds from 1980-01-01T00:00:00.
 
        DFMI_CLOCK_TIME:           The time at which data was obtained,
                                   with one second resolution.  This
                                   16 bit counter rolls over to 0
                                   after 65535.
 
        DFMI_SYNC:                 This column should be equal to A5,
                                   the sync value for the DFMI data
                                   stream.
 
        DFMI_MODE:                 Indicates if DFMI is in calibration
                                   or normal mode.  Valid values are
                                   NORM, IFC1, IFC2, IFC3, IFC4.  See
                                   DFMI Calibration Document for more
                                   details.
 
        DFMI_READOUT_RATE:         Indicates the Readout rate:  valid
                                   values are CRUISE and ENCOUNTER.
                                   Cruise indicates that DFMI will
                                   read out data as often as 10Hz but
                                   as little as every 20 minutes.
                                   Encounter indicates that data will
                                   be read out as often as 10Hz, but
                                   at least every second.
 
        DFMI_WATCHDOG_RESET:       Indicates that a watchdog reset
                                   prompted the reset of the DFMI
                                   computer.  This value will only
                                   remain set for a single readout
                                   period.
 
        DFMI_SMALL_SENSOR_GAIN:    DFMI small sensor sensitivity is
                                   either HIGH or LOW.  If this value
                                   is High, the sensitivity relay is
                                   off and the small sensor is in the
                                   low mass range.  If this value is
                                   Low, the relay is on and the
                                   sensor is set to the high mass
                                   range. In the high mass range, all
                                   electronic thresholds for the
                                   small dust sensor are a factor 10
                                   greater than the low mass values.
                                   See the DFMI Calibration Document
                                   for more details.

       The data collected here has been prepared with the highest
       concern for the perfectness of the data delivered.  During the
       processing of the data in preparation for delivery with this
       volume, the structure of each data packet was verified.  This
       verification included detection of both the sync word and the
       length of each packet.
 
       The data that was used to produce this archive was generated
       on-board the spacecraft and telemetered to the NASA/JPL Deep
       Space Network (DSN) and decommutated by Applied Coherent
       Technology Corp for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Some of
       the data was selectively excluded from this archive by the
       principal investigator for DFMI.  These data were selectively
       excluded because the instrument was operating in a faulty
       manner, not even producing a proper sync byte.  The data that
       is included on this archive passes the data verification
       scheme mentioned above.
