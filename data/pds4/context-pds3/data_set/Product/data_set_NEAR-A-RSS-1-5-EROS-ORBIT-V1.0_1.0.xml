    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Near Earth Asteroid Rendevous (NEAR) Eros Radio Science
      (RS) Data Set is a time-ordered collection of raw and partially
      processed data collected during the NEAR orbital mapping of the
      asteroid 433 Eros. For more information on the investigation
      conducted, including gravity field and spin-state
      determinations, see references [YEOMANSETAL2000],
      [MILLERETAL2001] and [KONOPLIVETAL2001].
 
      The radiometric data also supported NEAR Navigation.
 
      The data set includes:
 
        Directory   Description
        ---------   -----------
           ODF      Orbit Data Files containing closed-loop (two-way)
                     Doppler and sequential range measurements.
           EOP      Earth-Orientation Parameter file
           ION      Ionosphere calibration file
           TRO      Troposphere calibration file
           TXT      Text files describing physical model inputs
                      and estimated solution parameters
 
      Typical users of these data might analyze range and Doppler
      measurements in the ODF to derive the NEAR trajectory during
      the rendevous/mapping phase, determining gravity field, mass,
      and spin-state.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The ODF contains the most important information (range and
      Doppler) needed by spacecraft navigators and those interested
      in determining gravitational parameters of Eros. Each ODF
      is accompanied by a full PDS label which describes both the
      content and format of the associated file.  ODF data types
      can include those listed below. Only those marked below with an
      asterisk are present in this data set ODF.
 
           Narrowband spacecraft VLBI, Doppler mode (cycles)
           Narrowband spacecraft VLBI, phase mode (cycles)
           Narrowband quasar VLBI, Doppler mode (cycles)
           Narrowband quasar VLBI, phase mode (cycles)
           Wideband spacecraft VLBI (nanoseconds)
           Wideband quasar VLBI (nanoseconds)

                units)
        *  SRA planetary operational discrete spectrum range (range
                units)
           RE[GSTDN] range (nanoseconds)
           Azimuth angle (degrees)
           Elevation angle (degrees)
           Hour angle (degrees)
           Declination angle (degrees)
           X angle (where +X is east) (degrees)
           Y angle (where +X is east) (degrees)
           X angle (where +X is south) (degrees)
           Y angle (where +X is south) (degrees)
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      ODF&apos;s are screened for &apos;bad&apos; data points, which are removed
      prior to analysis by the navigation or radio science teams.
      However, all data is included in these archived ODF&apos;s files,
      including &apos;bad&apos; data that may have been excluded during radio
      science or navigation analysis.
 
    Data
    ====
      ODFs were issued approximately daily during the orbit phase,
      occasionally more often to support critical events such as
      engine-firings (for maneuvers).
 
      These ODFs are stored in the ODF directory. File name is of the
      form  ydddeeeC.ODF  where  y  is the one-digit year (2000-2001
      implicit) of the first data, ddd is the three-digit day-of-year
      of the first data,  eee  is the three-digit day-of-year of the
      last data. Symbol C denotes an alphabetic character
      distinguishing separate files issued during the same day.
 
      The preliminary results of this investigation (the solved-for
      Eros ephemeris corrections, pole direction, rotation state,
      GM (in km^3/s^2), spherical harmonic gravity coefficients and
      surface crater landmarks), are summarized in PARAMSUM.TXT in
      the TXT directory.
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Ancillary files are needed for proper analysis and
      interpretation of the radio data (file type ODF).   These are
      organized in parallel directories and stored approximately
      chronologically.
 
      Earth Orientation Parameter Files (EOP Directory)
      ---------------------------------------------------
        Earth Orientation Parameter files are produced by the Time
        and Earth Motion Precision Observation (TEMPO) Group at JPL.
        They are ASCII files with variable length records.  Each
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed &lt;LF&gt; (ASCII 10).
        EOP files, issued three times a week, include results based
        on fits to historical data as well as extrapolated predictions
        into the future.  Subsequent file releases gradually replaced
        predict-intervals with data-based actual values. In this
        archive, three files have been selected such that they cover
        the NEAR orbit phase with data-based actual values.
        File names have the form ydddzeee.EOP  where  y  is
        the one-digit year of the first data in the file (2000-2001 is
        implicit),  ddd  is the day-of-year of the first data in the
        file,  z  is the one-digit year of the last data, and  eee  is
        the day-of-year of the last data in the file.  Each file
        covers the previous nine months of past motion,  with
        prediction for three months into the future; files are
        typically 30 KB.  Each EOP file is accompanied by a PDS
        minimal label with file name  ydddzeee.LBL.
 
 
      Ionosphere Calibration Files (ION Directory)
      ---------------------------------------------------
        Ionosphere Calibration files are produced by the
        Tracking System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL.
        These are ASCII files of variable length records.  Each
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed &lt;LF&gt; (ASCII 10).
        The file name has the form  ydddzeee.ION  where  y  is
        the one-digit year of the first data in the file (2000 is
        implicit),  ddd  is the day-of-year of the first data in the
        file, z  is the one-digit year of the last data in the file
        (2001 is implicit), and  eee  is the day-of-year of the last
        data in the file. ION files were released at one week
        intervals to cover a single month and included predicts for
        the rest of the month. The single file archived here is a
        concatenation of file releases that were issued at the start
        of a month, containing actual measured values for the month
        just past.  The ION file is accompanied by a PDS minimal
        label with file name ydddzeee.LBL.
 
 
      Troposphere Calibration Files (TRO Directory)
      ---------------------------------------------------
        Troposphere Calibration files are produced by the
        Tracking System Analytic Calibration (TSAC) Group at JPL.
        These are ASCII files of variable length records.  Each
        record is delimited by an ASCII line-feed &lt;LF&gt; (ASCII 10).
        File names have the form  ydddzeee.TRO  where  y  is
        the one-digit year of the first data in the file,  ddd  is
        the day-of-year of the first data in the file,  z  is the
        one-digit year of the last data in the file and  eee  is the
        day-of-year of the last data in the file. File 00011060.TRO
        contains measured data from 2000-Jan-1 to 2001-Mar-1.  It is
        a concatenation of individual files released at the beginning
        of each month, covering the previous month. File 20018001.TRO
        contains a seasonal/cylical adjustment for each site,
        interpreted by software as being applicable from 1972-Jan-1
        to 2048-Jan-1. Each TRO file is accompanied by a PDS minimal
        label with file name  ydddzeee.LBL.
 
 
      Text Files (TXT Directory)
      --------------------------
        Two file types are included in the TXT directory. The first
        type is NMLMODL.TXT and is accompanied by a minimal PDS label
        NMLMODL.LBL. It is the nominal set of namelist parameters
        used to define physical characteristics of the spacecraft&apos;s
        motion and tracking observables used by the JPL orbit
        determination software suite.  These are initial starting
        models only; final solution models are not represented. The
        second file is PARAMSUM.TXT, accompanied by minimal PDS label
        PARAMSUM.LBL. This is a summary of the preliminary solved-for
        parameter set. DMW_433, DP_433, DQ_433, EDW_433, DA_433,
        DE_433 are the corrections to the Eros ephemeris in Brouwer
        and Clemence Set III coordinates. ZACPL2000433, ZDEPL2000433
        and WDP2000433 are the pole RA, DEC and Prime Meridian angle
        with respect to the Equinox and Mean Equator of Epoch J2000.0,
        in degrees.  GM2000433 is the solved-for Eros GM in units of
        km^3/s^2. This is followed by spherical harmonic gravity
        coefficients to degree and order 15, then (x,y,z) Cartesian
        landmark coordinates (km) in the Eros body frame. The
        &apos;NEW SOLUTION&apos; column contains the preliminary estimated
        values, with &apos;SIGMA&apos; being the formal one standard-deviation
        uncertainty of those estimates. The full and final geophysical
        parameter solution set will be archived separately with
        the DATA_SET_ID of &apos;NEAR-A-RSS-5-GRAVITY-V1.0&apos;
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Analysis was conducted in the frame of the DE-403 solar system
      model, aligned with the 1993 ICRF/J2000 reference frame.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing data such as
      these has been developed at several institutions and elsewhere.
      Because such software must usually operate at the bit-level and
      is written for a narrow range of platforms, it is not suitable
      for general distribution.  No software is included with this
      archival data set.

    Overview
    ========
      Data in this archival data set have been processed as part of
      the activities of the NEAR Radio Science Team. This is an
      excellent data set.
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the NEAR Radio Science
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
 
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of
      example PDS labels, CATALOG files, and Software Interface
      Specifications (SIS).  These materials were distributed to PDS
      personnel, the experiment investigator, and others,
      as appropriate.

    Limitations
    ===========
      The limitations in this data set derive from tracking geometry
      and measurement data types. There are no known general or
      systematic defects in the data.
