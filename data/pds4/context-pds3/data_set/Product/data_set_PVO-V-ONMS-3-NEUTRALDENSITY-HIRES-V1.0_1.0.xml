            This data set has at least preliminary composition for every data
            point measured but not necessarily final composition values. The
            instrument was designed to determine the composition of the
            neutral thermosphere/exosphere of Venus. The term composition
            includes both the type of neutral gases present and their
            quantitative amount. The measurements begin at the orbit&apos;s
            periapsis altitude and extend to a limiting altitude at which the
            ambient signal becomes comparable to the gas background and/or
            detector measurement threshold. The neutral composition includes
            helium, atomic nitrogen, atomic oxygen, molecular nitrogen,
            carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The data reduction has been
            described in [NIEMANNETAL1980A] and [KASPRZAKETAL1980].

      This data set has at least preliminary composition for every
      data point measured but not necessarily final composition
      values.
 
      The instrument was designed to determine the composition of the
      neutral thermosphere/exosphere of Venus.  The term composition
      includes both the type of neutral gases present and their
      quantitative amount.  The measurements begin at the orbit&apos;s
      periapsis altitude and extend to a limiting altitude at which
      the ambient signal becomes comparable to the gas background
      and/or detector measurement threshold.  The neutral composition
      includes helium, atomic nitrogen, atomic oxygen, molecular
      nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The data
      reduction has been described in [NIEMANNETAL1980A] and

                                    recombination of O to CO2(*)
 
      (*) the correction is based on matching scale height
          temperatures of O and CO2.
 
      The data are from the nonretarding potential mode of the
      instrument.  Data from the retarding mode are consistent with
      those obtained from the nonretarding mode and have not been
      included.  The data set does not include the factor of 1.6
      increase in density needed to maintain compatibility with other
      data sets as discussed by [HEDINETAL1983].  Two data sets are
      provided: high resolution (HIRES), every point, composition;
      and low resolution (LORES), 12 second sampled, composition.
      The LORES data set represents the best estimated composition
      data and is derived from the HIRES data set.

                                  (not fully corrected)
                            M for mass flagged
                                  (problem point; probably
                                   wrong)
                            N for final density negative
                                  (only preliminary density
                                   given)

     Notes:
 
     1) For CO2 both ODENS and FDENS are given since the final
        correction to this species depends on a model:
 
        (new CO2 density) =
             (old CO2 density) - 0.019 x (old O density)
 
        (new O density) = (old O density) + 0.019 x (old O density)
 
        Only the New O density is given.
 
     2) Mass flagged points are usually points that fall
        excessively beyond range of the main body of the data.
        They may be wild points, points with wrong mass
        designations or simply wrong for other reasons.
 
     3) The best estimate of the density is to be found in the
        F data.
 
     4) Data with errors greater than about 30% should be
        considered unreliable.
 
     5) The angle of attack is included to help sort out low data
        values due to antenna shadowing (all species) which occurs
        beyond 40 degrees and high value ram points seen in He at
        angles of attack less than 10 degrees.  Some of these
        points have already been mass flagged. In general, it would
        be best to not include data in these regions.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      Several criteria were invoked when inserting data for a given
      orbit: orbit and attitude parameters must exist (project
      supplied); the spacecraft format and bit rate must be
      appropriate for acquisition of data by the ONMS; and the
      command sequence for the instrument must be appropriate for
      useful determination of atmospheric composition.  Cases where
      useful composition cannot be determined include special test
      modes (e.g., retarding potential sweeps, filament off) and 1/8
      unit amu sweep modes.  In addition, composition for the LORES
      data set cannot be easily determined for unit amu sweep mode.
      The ONMS was not operational for every orbit nor is every orbit
      complete due to data gaps introduced by use of telemetry
      formats for which the ONMS has no instrument output.
 
      Useful composition data are gathered from the lowest periapsis
      altitude to a maximum altitude generally around 250 km (about
      300 km for He).  The actual maximum altitude depends on the
      accumulated surface gas buildup acquired from previous orbits
      which creates a gas background.  The gas background was
      estimated from high altitude averages of the data and for all
      species, except helium, an inbound signal/background ratio of 2
      and an outbound signal/background ratio of 4 were used as
      cutoff values.  In some cases superthermal ions (e.g.,
      [KASPRZAKETAL1982]) were observed at low altitudes (e.g., below
      300 km for orbit 219) and these were removed when visually
      detected.  Some problems have been observed in the high
      altitude data very near cutoff, particularly for outbound N2.
      Several data points were never removed and appear higher than
      the expected extrapolation of the data to that time.
 
      Residual spin modulation which had not been completely removed
      is evident in the processed data.  The source of the spin
      residuals are the gas/surface adsorption/desorption effects
      which were not removed from the data and a noncosine behavior
      for the response of the ion source density with angle of
      attack.  Another feature observed occasionally at large angles
      of attack (&gt;40 degrees) is a reduction of the data when
      compared to data at lower angles of attack.  This has been
      determined to be due to antenna shadowing; that is, the ONMS
      geometric view cone &apos;sees&apos; the spacecraft antenna at extreme
      angles of attack.  Occasionally near minimum angle of attack
      (&lt;10 degrees), enhanced data points are observed for m/e=4 (He
      channel) which are apparently high energy ions/neutrals
      traveling along the tube axis and being detected.  The more
      extreme points in either of these two cases have been mass
      flagged.
 
      The data time spacing depends on the spacecraft bit rate and
      format, and the particular instrument commands executed.
      Usually programmed mass format was used but occasionally unit
      amu and 1/8 amu sweeps were implemented.  Several orbits
      switched from low electron energy to high electron energy and
      as a result there may be a discontinuity at the transition
      point.  The 1/8 amu sweep data have not been included.
 
      Atomic nitrogen was measured in programmed mass mode only after
      orbit 190.
 
      Orbits 1-19 generally do not have reliable relative composition
      due to the fact that gas-surface processes in the ion source
      had not stabilized.  This affects all surface reactive species
      except He.
 
      Isolated (one or two points per several spin cycles) high
      resolution data points are occasionally observed and they
      should be regarded as erroneous points which are more likely
      wrong than right.
 
      The error associated with the points is more an indication of
      data quality than of absolute uncertainty.  It contains the
      statistical error of the data determined for the principle m/e
      used for the species from the detector signal plus the errors
      coming from any other species used to correct the data.  It
      also contains a contribution which is proportional to the
      background/signal ratio.  The total relative error is at least
      an additional 5-10% above this value.
