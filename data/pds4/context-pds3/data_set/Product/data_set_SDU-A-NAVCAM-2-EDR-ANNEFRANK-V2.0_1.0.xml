    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
      This data set contains raw pre-encounter and encounter images
      taken by the Stardust Navigation Camera during the encounter
      with asteroid Annefrank.  This is version 2.0 of the dataset, in
      which the IMG formatted images have been converted to FITS
      format, and a number of corrections, described below, have been
      applied.  This version supersedes version 1.0.
 
      Every image provided in this data set was taken as a part of a
      particular imaging sequence, each of which is described in this
      section by the NAVCAM Science Lead, Dr. Raymond L. Newburn, Jr.
      For the complete list of images and their parameters, refer to
      the data set&apos;s index table, INDEX/INDEX.TAB. For additional
      notes on individual images also consult with the document ``Log
      of Stardust NAVCAM Flight Images&apos;&apos;, DOCUMENT/PIIMGLOG.PDF,
      provided with this data set.
 
      2002-09-03: Image Sequence #32 (Images 301-324)
      -----------------------------------------------
        In preparation for engineering readiness tests utilizing the
        asteroid #5535 Annefrank, as STARDUST once more approached the
        Sun and Earth sufficiently to begin limited imaging, a first
        test was made of the new pattern matching and windowing
        software. Coincident with this, a series of geometric
        calibrations was attempted, since those of June 2001 were not
        totally successful. In addition a calibration lamp image and
        four full frame fields were acquired at zero and thirty
        degrees, one of the latter compressed. These were intended as a
        modestly comprehensive check for contamination, for scattered
        light, and for compression. It was found that there had been a
        small amount of recontamination in the 10 months since the
        previous image. This was most obvious in the calibration lamp
        image. Star images remained sharp, with the same point spread
        as earlier, but with a very shallow skirt of scattered light.
        The pattern matching and windowing failed at 14 of the 19
        angles. At larger scan mirror angles there was a problem with
        increasing scattered light. The windows used were only 21x21
        pixels, and it became clear that somewhat larger windows were
        necessary and that there were still geometric calibration
        problems. The contamination on the periscope was found to be
        significantly reduced compared to that of two years earlier,
        perhaps due to some evaporation of the condensate into the
        vacuum of space.
 
      2002-10-09: Image Sequence #33 (Images 325-345)
      -----------------------------------------------
        This series of images again was intended as a test of pattern
        matching and windowing and to supply some geometric calibration
        of the system. The camera was brought above freezing for 60
        hours and then allowed to cool back to normal operating
        temperatures in an effort to remove contamination before
        initiating these exposures. The series consisted of 20 pattern
        matching and windowing tests, ten each at 47.8 and 64.0 degree
        scan mirror settings, each image consisting of four 41x41 pixel
        windows, and one full frame image at a scan mirror setting of
        15 degrees to check on the effect of a split field (partially
        on and partially off the periscope). Half of the 47.8 degree
        and all of the 64.0 degree tests were successful in locking up
        on the desired pattern of stars, but the target stars still
        were not well centered. These were engineering tests and led to
        significant improvement in the software and to a better
        understanding of spacecraft behavior and capabilities, but the
        images provided little useful data for any sort of photometric
        calibration following the fourth heating cycle that preceded
        this series. The split image indicated that it should be
        possible to use the periscope on Wild 2 approach as always
        intended. Good geometric calibration of the periscope still
        remains to be carried out, and the periscope was not used for
        the Annefrank encounter. In the absence of any dust hazard, it
        was not necessary to keep the spacecraft oriented along the
        velocity vector, so Annefrank tracking utilized mirror angles
        from 17.7 to 111.3 degrees.
 
      2002-10-31: Image Sequence #34 (Images 346-350)
      -----------------------------------------------
        One of the goals of the engineering readiness tests on
        Annefrank was to exercise the optical navigation team and to
        attempt to improve flyby accuracy using optical data. The
        approach to Annefrank was from a phase angle of 150 degrees,
        unfortunately, which meant the asteroid would be poorly
        illuminated and be very faint. There were no asteroid data
        available for phase angles larger than 100 degrees. It was
        assumed that Annefrank would be about 1.5 magnitudes fainter
        than the nearly linear decrease of about 0.03 mag/deg that is
        common to asteroids at smaller phase angles. It seemed that we
        would have a fair chance of detection 38 hours before
        encounter, which time was used for this first attempt. Five
        images were obtained using three 151x151 pixel windows and
        exposures of 1, 1, 2, 5, and 5 seconds. As we later found out,
        the asteroid was much fainter than expected and the spacecraft
        drift during the exposures (smear rate) much larger than we had
        previously experienced. Further the camera pointing was not as
        accurate as we had expected (the geometric calibration was not
        yet solid). The use of new controller software, inadequate
        settle times after attitude changes, and a larger moment of
        inertia with the aerogel grid open were all suggested as
        reasons for the drift and pointing problems. The cause is still
        being investigated. This is why these tests were run, to make
        sure something like this doesn&apos;t happen to us on Wild 2. The
        bottom line is that the asteroid was not found in these five
        E-38 hour images.
 
      2002-10-31: Image Sequence #35 (Images 351-355)
      -----------------------------------------------
        A second set of approach images was acquired at E-32 hours. The
        same windows and exposure times were used as for the previous
        set at E-38 hours. The problems were much the same, as were the
        results. Annefrank was not found.
 
      2002-10-31: Image Sequence #36 (Images 356-360)
      -----------------------------------------------
        A third set of images was acquired at E-26 hours. The same
        windows and exposure times were used as for the previous sets
        taken at E-38 and E-32 hours. The problems were much the same,
        as were the results. Annefrank was not found.
 
      2002-11-01: Image Sequence #37 (Images 361-365)
      -----------------------------------------------
        Given the experience of the first three sets of approach
        images, the navigators decided to increase the window size to
        181x181 pixels and make all of the exposures 5 seconds for this
        set at E-18 hours. The image smear can only be described as
        horrendous. This doesn&apos;t matter for measurement purposes, IF
        the target can be found. The asteroid was still several
        magnitudes too faint for detection when smeared over some 20
        pixels, and it was not located.
 
      2002-11-01: Image Sequence #38 (Images 366-370)
      -----------------------------------------------
        A final set of approach images was attempted at E-12 hours.
        This time all of the available communication bandwidth was
        given to one window in one image (#368), making it 701x701
        pixels. The other four images were given 3x3 pixel windows and
        were retained only to avoid having to reprogram and transmit
        too much last minute new command software. The smear was still
        large (21.7 pixels) and the asteroid still was not located.
 
      2002-11-01: Image Sequence #39 (Images 371-407)
      -----------------------------------------------
        Twenty-five minutes before the closest approach, images were
        acquired to attempt autotracking. Pointing was based upon radio
        navigation of the spacecraft and the best ephemeris for the
        asteroid supplied by JPL&apos;s celestial mechanics specialists. By
        this time the phase angle was down to 130 degrees and the range
        was only 11,415 km. Annefrank appeared in the first image,
        though far from centered. The navigators chose an exposure of
        65 ms to make sure they were going ``deep enough,&apos;&apos; so the
        images were well exposed. After the first few images, only
        every third image was transmitted to the ground, the others
        being used only to initiate autotrack. After 15 minutes, at a
        range of 5434 km, exposure was reduced to 25 ms. In all, 15 of
        37 images taken with 65 ms exposure were received on Earth. Of
        these, the first two or three were partially on the periscope,
        and three show a large amount of smear, but several are of
        scientific use. Autotracking was initiated shortly before
        reducing the exposure, and image 410 and all subsequent
        Annefrank images are well centered in their frames.
 
      2002-11-01: Image Sequence #40 (Images 410-445)
      -----------------------------------------------
        Exposure times on Annefrank were reduced to 25 ms beginning
        with image 410 at a range of 5088 km and a phase angle of 113
        degrees. Images beginning with #420 started to show saturation.
        This was predicted, but these images were being taken to test
        the autotracking rather than for scientific purposes, and
        autotrack works perfectly well with saturated images. The
        images soon reached 80% saturation, so images 420 through 445
        are of limited scientific use. Every image was transmitted to
        the ground beginning with #426, a total of 26 images with 25 ms
        exposure. Twenty-two of these have some to nearly total
        saturation.
 
      2002-11-01: Image Sequence #41 (Images 446-476)
      -----------------------------------------------
        Beginning with image #446, exposure time was reduced to 5 ms.
        In fact the characteristics of the shutter are such that
        alternate images are given exposures shorter by 1.5 ms than the
        set value, so in fact all even numbered images have an exposure
        of 3.5 ms and odd numbered ones 5 ms. It was intended that
        these images be of scientific as well as engineering use. If
        Annefrank had not been acquired by this time, there was little
        hope of acquiring it, so there was no need to saturate the
        images. The subsequent images (through image 476) taken at
        phase angles from 71.0 to 47.2 degrees constitute the best
        images for scientific use. During this period the range fell
        from 3133 km to 3078.5 km and increased back to 3162 km, so
        there is minimal change to scale.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
      The images in this data set were created by the DMAPKTDECOM
      program developed by Applied Coherent Technology Corp, Herndon,
      Virginia and operated by the Stardust Data Management and Archive
      Team at JPL, Pasadena, California. This program assembled images
      from raw telemetry packets sent down by the spacecraft and
      populated the images labels with housekeeping values, decommutated
      the binary image headers, and computed geometry parameters using
      SPICE kernels. This program did not apply correction of any kind
      to the image data.
 
      In the cases when only certain sections of the detector were
      downlinked, the program filled the pixels in the image
      corresponding to the areas for which data had not been downlinked
      with hex null values (i.e., zeroes). In such images window
      objects were used to define the areas containing non-null data.
 
      The images were converted from PDS format into FITS format at
      the PDS Small Bodies Node.  For the images that originally
      consisted of window objects, the window data has been embedded
      into full-frame images, with regions that were not downlinked
      set to zero.  During the conversion process, the overscan pixels
      on both sides of the images were recovered from the IMG
      files. (For consistency, the overscan regions were inserted into
      the windowed images, though their pixel values are set to zero.)
      Also, the orientation set up so that the images are properly
      oriented when displayed as defined by the LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION
      and SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keywords, and the twist angle was
      corrected to conform to the PDS definition.
 
    Data
    ====
 
      The images in this data set were originally produced in standard
      PDS format, and then converted to FITS format. Each file
      includes a detached PDS label.  The label also describes the
      circumstances surrounding the collection of the calibration
      image.
 
      Camera Description
      ------------------
        The camera has a 1024x1024 array as the active portion of the
        CCD. The images that are stored on this volume, however, contain
        more than just the active portion of the CCD. Each line contains
        a sync pattern, a line counter, 12 baseline stabilization pixels,
        the 1024 pixels from the active portion of the CCD, and finally 8
        over-clock pixels used to measure the quantum efficiency. The
        number of rows for each image is always 1024, no matter what
        compression mode is used, but the number of columns for each
        image depends on the compression mode used.
 
      Compression Modes
      -----------------
        The NAVCAM images can be either 8-bit or 12-bit data. The 12-bit
        data is commonly referred to as &apos;uncompressed data&apos;, while the
        8-bit is referred to as &apos;compressed data&apos;. This compression is
        accomplished by a 12-bit to 8-bit square-root look-up-table
        compression method, which is implemented in the hardware of the
        camera electronics. This compression is lossy and the estimate of
        the 12-bit image can be recovered using the look-up table
        mentioned in Appendix 3 of the Calibration Document. Both the
        image and histogram portions of the data file require different
        amounts of storage space, dependent on the compression mode used.
 
        In uncompressed mode with 12-bit data, the pixels are expressed
        in two bytes, as 16 bits per pixel. The upper nibble of the most
        significant byte is always zero for these images. In compressed
        mode with 8-bit data, the pixels are expressed in a single byte.
 
        During the conversion to FITS format, all of the images were
        stored as 16-bit integers.  A record of whether the original
        data were compressed or not is retained in the
        COMPRESSION_TYPE keyword in the PDS labels (COMPRESS in the
        FITS header).  A value of &apos;8_BIT&apos; indicates the 8-bit data, and
        a value of &apos;NONE&apos; denotes uncompressed images.
 
 
      Exposure Durations
      ------------------
        The double-bladed shutter utilized by the camera has a delay
        in its slide mechanism that introduces an offset in the actual
        exposure time, compared to the commanded exposure time.  In
        version 1.0 of this dataset, an attempt was made to correct
        this problem, however, during the recalibration of the NAVCAM
        as part of the Stardust NExT mission, it was determined that
        the original information about the exposure time offsets and
        the forward/reverse shutter parity were incorrect.  In this
        version (2.0) the images have been corrected to account for
        the updated information.  See the file SHUTTER_CORRECTION.ASC
        in the documents directory for more information.
 
 
      Target Name in the Image Labels
      -------------------------------
        The target name in the image labels was set only for the images
        where the target is either seen in the image or computed to be
        with the camera field of view. For all other images the target
        name was set to ``CALIBRATION FIELD&apos;&apos;.
 
        Consequently the label geometry items pertaining to the target
        -- spacecraft-target position, velocity and distance, pixel
        scales, and phase angle -- are only supplied for the images
        where target name is not ``CALIBRATION FIELD&apos;&apos; and were computed
        for that specified target.
 
      Windowed Images
      ---------------
        The IMAGE size parameter in the image label reflects the size
        of the detector, however in some cases data from only certain
        sections of the detector were downlinked. In these cases the
        pixels in the image corresponding to the areas for which data
        had not been downlinked are filled with hex null values (i.e.,
        zeroes).
 
      Noise in the Images
      -------------------
        If the images are stretched to the limit, regular wide
        horizontal stripes appear in every image at the level of 1 to 2
        dn above background. These appear to be the product of coherent
        noise somewhere in the data stream or from a power supply.
        Their source is unknown.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
 
      The geometry items included in the image labels were computed
      using the following SPICE kernels archived in the Stardust SPICE
      data set, SDU-C-SPICE-6-V1.0:
 
         Kernel Type   File Name
         ------------  ---------------------
         LSK           naif0008.tls
         PCK           pck00007.tpc
         PCK           sdu_annefrank_v01.tpc
         SCLK          sdu_sclkscet_00141.tsc
         FK            sdu_v20.tf
         IK            sdu_navcam_v22.ti
         SPK           sdu_l_2002.bsp
         SPK           sdu_w2_opnav.bsp
         CK (s/c)      sdu_sc_rec_2002_v2.bc
         CK (s/c)      sdu_sc_rec_w2_opnav.bc
         CK (camera)   sdu_nc_rec_v2.bc
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
      Geometric Parameter Reference Frame
      -----------------------------------
        Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 is the inertial
        reference system used to specify observational geometry items
        provided in the image labels. Geometric parameters are based on
        best available SPICE data at time of image creation.
 
      Epoch of Geometric Parameters
      -----------------------------
        All geometric parameters provided in the image labels were
        computed at the epoch specified in the START_TIME label field.
 
      Image Orientation and Geometry
      ------------------------------
        In version 1.0 of this data set, the image orientation was was
        flipped from what would be seen by an actual observer.  In
        addition, the TWIST_ANGLE that was given did not correspond to
        the definition in the PDS Data Dictionary.  Both of these
        inconsistencies have been corrected in this version of the data.
        When displayed as defined in the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keywords, the image would appear as it
        would to an in situ observer, and the TWIST_ANGLE corresponds to
        the definition given in the PDS Data Dictionary.  Additional
        keywords have been added to the FITS header to better define the
        geometry, including the Celestial and Ecliptic North clock
        angles and the projected sunward vector clock angle.
        In this version, all geometric parameters have been recomputed
        using the most recent SPICE kernels (listed above)
 
 
    Software
    ========
 
      The images in this data set are in standard FITS format and,
      therefore, can be viewed by any standardized FITS reader.  For
      this reason no special software is provided with this data set.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
      During the processing of the image data in preparation for
      delivery with this volume, the structure of each image was
      verified. This verification included detection of both the sync
      word and the line count bytes at the beginning of each line.
 
 
    Review
    ======
 
      The images have been reviewed and validated by the imaging team
      members as well as by the other project teams -- Optical
      Navigation Team (OPNAV) and Data Management and Archive Team
      (DMA.)
 
       The updated dataset will be peer reviewed in October 2009.
 
 
    Missing Data
    ============
 
      Due to the operational constraints on telemetry playback, some of
      the images in this data set have been assembled from an
      incomplete set of packets, specifically images 306, 383, 475, and
      476. In these images the areas for which data were not downlinked
      are filled with hex null values (i.e., zeroes).
