            The purpose of this report is to describe the methodology used to
            produce Reduced Data Records (RDRs) for the Phoenix Atmospheric
            Structure Experiment (ASE) from its Experimental Data Records
            (EDRs). These RDRs include vertical profiles of atmospheric
            density, pressure, and temperature.

Data Set Overview
==================
 
This dataset consists of data products derived from data collected
by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the Phoenix spacecraft
during its entry into the martian atmosphere. The DATA/ directory
contains two data files (PHXPROFILE.TAB and PHXCOMPACT.TAB).
PHXPROFILE.TAB contains time ordered records of smoothed acceleration,
derived velocity, derived position, derived atmospheric properties and
other derived quantities. PHXCOMPACT.TAB contains position and
atmospheric properties at 1 km vertical intervals. PHXPROFILE.TAB is
the more comprehensive set of results. PHXCOMPACT.TAB is intended for
those users who are only interested in the atmospheric properties.

The contents of PHXCOMPACT.TAB are derived from the contents of
PHXPROFILE.TAB as described below.
 
Timing
======
 
All data products in this dataset are derived from PDS volume
PHXASE_0001 [CATLINGETAL2008], which expresses times with respect
to a UTC reference time of 2008-05-25T23:30:47.918. All times
in this dataset are expressed relative to the UTC reference time
of 2008-05-25T23:00:00.000. Thus a time of 0.000 in [CATLINGETAL2008]
would be written as 1847.918 seconds in this dataset.
 
Coordinate Systems
==================
 
All data products in this dataset are derived from 200 Hz IMU
measurements in DATA/IMU_A_EDR_M.TAB of PDS volume PHXASE_0001
[CATLINGETAL2008]. These acceleration measurements are given in an
XYZ cartesian frame fixed relative to the spacecraft. Specifically,
the Phoenix mechanical frame, also known as the PHX_LANDER frame
or the M frame, which has NAIF ID -84001. This spacecraft
frame is neither inertial nor fixed relative to Mars. The spacecraft
is axisymmetric about the Z axis in this frame.
 
The data products in PDS volume PHXASE_0001 [CATLINGETAL2008] were
transmitted to Earth in a different frame, the IMU frame, and then
transformed into the M frame before being archived. During the course
of the preparation of this dataset, it was discovered that a preliminary
version of the appropriate transformation matrix had been used. The
preliminary matrix corresponds to the spacecraft as designed, not as
built.
 
The vector accelerations and angular velocities in DATA/IMU_A_EDR_M.TAB
of PDS volume PHXASE_0001 [CATLINGETAL2008] should be multiplied by
the following matrix to transform them into the actual M frame.
 
[New X] = [ 0.99991267    -0.00087993926  -0.013188274  ] [Old X]
[New Y] = [ 0.00090164837  0.99999798      0.0016463352 ] [Old Y]
[New Z] = [ 0.013186473   -0.0016580001    0.99991177   ] [Old Z]
 
Where the vector with components [New X, New Y, and New Z] is the
corrected vector, the vector with components [Old X, Old Y, and Old Z]
is the vector from DATA/IMU_A_EDR_M.TAB in PDS volume PHXASE_0001,
and the XYZ axes refer to the M frame. Further details are given in
DOCUMENT/REPORT.LBL.
 
Acceleration measurements included in this dataset (X_ACCELERATION,
Y_ACCELERATION, Z_ACCELERATION and associated uncertainties) are
expressed in the Phoenix cruise frame, also known as the
PHX_LANDER_CRUISE frame or the C frame, which has NAIF ID -84000.
The spacecraft is axisymmetric about the X axis in this frame.
The relationship between the M and C frames is stated in
DOCUMENT/EDRSIS.LBL of PDS volume PHXASE_0001 [CATLINGETAL2008].
Axial accelerations are parallel to the X axis of the C frame and
normal accelerations are perpendicular to the X axis of the C frame.
 
Position and velocity (X_POSITION, Y_POSITION, Z_POSITION and
associated uncertainties; X_VELOCITY, Y_VELOCITY, Z_VELOCITY and
associated uncertainties) are given in an XYZ cartesian frame
whose origin is at the center of mass of Mars. The +Z axis
passes through the north pole and the +X axis passes through the
equator at zero degrees east areocentric longitude at a specified
time. The +Y axis completes a right-handed set. The specified time
is the UTC reference time of 2008-05-25T23:00:00.000. Position is
also given as radial distance, areocentric latitude, and
areocentric longitude. This is the standard spherical polar
coordinate system found in mathematical textbooks. Longitude
increases to the east. Altitude is defined as radial distance
minus the radial distance from the center of mass of Mars to
the landing site, 3376.3 km. Altitude is not referenced to any
equipotential surface.
 
The orientation of Phoenix is described by the quaternion that
relates the C frame to the J2000 frame, which is defined by the
Earth&apos;s mean equator and equinox at the J2000.0 epoch. The
convention that quaternion [Q0, Q1, Q2, Q3] corresponds to a
rotation about the axis parallel to the vector QV = [Q1, Q2, Q3]
by an angle 2 cos-1(Q0) was adopted.
 
Data Processing
===============
 
Data processing for PHXPROFILE.TAB is described in DOCUMENT/REPORT.LBL.
Many aspects of the reconstruction were similar to the reconstruction
reported in PDS volume MERIMU_2001 [WITHERS&amp;MURPHY2009].
 
Not all data products are defined at all timesteps. Data
products derived in the atmospheric structure reconstruction are
not defined above about 130 km nor below about 15 km. Such data
products are given the null value -1 in the PHXPROFILE.TAB.
 
The contents of PHXCOMPACT.TAB were derived from the contents of
PHXPROFILE.TAB. The dependent variable in PHXCOMPACT.TAB is altitude,
which is defined as the difference between the radial distance to
Phoenix and the radial distance to the landing site (3376.3 km). The
prefix M is used frequently in PHXCOMPACT.TAB to distinguish variables
in PHXCOMPACT.TAB from similar variables in PHXPROFILE.TAB. This M
stands for mean, since many of the values contained in PHXCOMPACT.TAB
are averages of values reported in PHXPROFILE.TAB. A series of
altitude levels were defined as 1 km, 2 km, ..., 146 km and
labelled as MALTITUDE. Each value of MRADIAL_DISTANCE was defined as
the sum of the corresponding value of MALTITUDE and 3376.3 km.
Each value of SIGMA_MRADIAL_DISTANCE was defined as the arithmetic
mean of SIGMA_RADIAL_DISTANCE for all data points in PHXPROFILE.TAB
whose value of RADIAL_DISTANCE is within 0.5 km of the relevant value
of MRADIAL_DISTANCE. SIGMA_MALTITUDE was defined to equal
SIGMA_MRADIAL_DISTANCE. Each value of MRHO was defined as the geometric
mean of all values of RHO whose value of RADIAL_DISTANCE is within
0.5 km of the relevant value of MRADIAL_DISTANCE. Values of SIGMA_MRHO,
MPRESS, SIGMA_MPRESS and SIGMA_MTEMP were defined similarly. MTEMP was
calculated from MRHO and MPRESS using the same ideal gas law as was used
to produce TEMP in PHXPROFILE.TAB. If all DENSITY values in PHXPROFILE.TAB
whose values of RADIAL_DISTANCE are within 0.5 km of a given value of
MRADIAL_DISTANCE in PHXCOMPACT.TAB are null (-1), then all atmospheric
properties at this MRADIAL_DISTANCE in PHXCOMPACT.TAB are given the null
value -1.

Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
 
Data coverage is excellent. The only minor gaps in the data series
are discussed in DOCUMENT/REPORT.LBL. Uncertainties in the data used
in the reconstruction and in the resultant data products are discussed
above, in DOCUMENT/REPORT.LBL and in [CATLINGETAL2008].
 
Limitations and Caveats
=======================
 
As discussed in DOCUMENT/REPORT.LBL, the angle of attack can be
determined by two different methods. The results obtained by the two
methods differ by 1-2 degrees, which is relatively large. This issue has
not been resolved.
