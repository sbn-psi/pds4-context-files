    Data Set Overview
    =================
      This data set contains Voyager 1 and 2 measurements of the
      brightness of Saturn at H Lyman alpha and in the H2 Lyman and
      Werner bands shortward of H Lyman alpha.  Pointing has been
      corrected by the C-Smithing process, and these data were derived
      from the pre-encounter North-South Map sequences.  In this
      sequence, the UVS field of view was located near the central
      meridian of the planet.  The field of view stepped slowly from
      north to south, and then rapidly repositioned to the north.
      These scans were repeated until all longitudes had been sampled.
      Coverage in longitude was nearly continuous in time.  There were
      short breaks for observations of satellites.
 
      The brightnesses represent integrals over the appropriate
      passband that have been computed from the full spectrum.  The
      spectra were binned by Flight Data System (FDS) count, so that
      each record contains the data from one 48-second frame.
      Because the motion of the scan platform was synchronized with
      FDS count, each record corresponds to a single pointing
      position on Saturn.  The first two spectra of each FDS count
      have been excluded, because the scan platform was moving during
      those times.  In some cases (e.g.  during the flyback slews to
      prepare for another N/S scan) all spectra were flagged with bad
      pointing status, and no spectra appear in the output bin.  The
      data in each time bin was normalized by dividing by the number
      of spectra binned, so that the spectra represent counts per
      3.84 second interval (the integration time in the GS-3 data
      mode used for most of the encounter sequences).  The final
      processing step in the spectral analysis stage was a correction
      for fixed pattern noise (flat fielding).
 
      The brightnesses were computed by summing over the appropriate
      wavelength channels.  These are:
 
                             Voyager 1
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          43 - 58             924 - 1072
            H Lyman alpha     70 - 78            1174 - 1257
 
                             Voyager 2
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          45 - 60             921 - 1069
            H Lyman alpha     72 - 80            1171 - 1254
 
      The brightnesses were corrected for dark counts, which arise
      mainly from the radiation environment.  Because the
      radiation-induced dark count rate depends rather sensitively on
      the magnetic latitude of the spacecraft, and hence on time,
      this correction is made on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis.  For
      the H Lyman alpha emission, the procedure also compensates
      approximately for H2 band emissions that fall within the H
      Lyman alpha channel range.  This correction procedure consists
      of subtracting the sum over suitably chosen background
      channels.  These background channels are:
 
                             Voyager 1
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          23 - 38             739 -  887
            H Lyman alpha     58 - 66            1063 - 1146
 
                             Voyager 2
          Emission          channel range      wavelength range (A)
            H2 bands          25 - 40             736 -  884
            H Lyman alpha     60 - 68            1060 - 1143
 
      Each record contains pointing information that consists of the
      latitude and SLS longitude of the two ends of the slit (P2
      and P8 points) and the center of the slit (P5 point) projected
      on Saturn.  In addition, each point has associated with it a
      status flag.  A minus (-) means that the line of sight for the
      specified point intersects the planet.  A plus (+) means that
      the line of sight is off the planet.  In the latter case, the
      latitude and longitude refer to the point on the planet that is
      under the point of closest approach to the planet of the line
      of sight.
 
      Each logical record corresponds to one FDS count, and consists
      of three lines in the data file.  The quantities on each line
      are:
 
          first line:  Spacecraft Event Time, FDS count, S/C to
                       Saturn range.
 
         second line:  P2 latitude, P2 longitude, P5 latitude,
                       P5 longitude, P8 latitude, P8 longitude,
                       P2 status, P5 status, P8 status
 
          third line:  H Lyman alpha counts, H2 band counts.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      Bad spectra resulting from telemetry noise and other effects
      have been omitted from this data set.  Spectra acquired when
      the scan platform was in motion have also been omitted to
      reduce spatial smearing as much as possible.  Some spatial
      smearing due to s/c limit cycle motions is unavoidable.
 
      The pointing information for the data set was derived by the
      C-Smithing (image navigation) process at JPL.  A short period
      at the beginning of the observation (FDSC 43945:33 to 43952:39)
      was not included in the C-Smithing process and we have filled
      in with pointing data from SEDR FUV 05402.  This improved
      pointing is believed to be the most accurate pointing
      information available.
