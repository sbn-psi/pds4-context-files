            This data set includes values for the fluxes of heavy ions
            associated with an energetic particle event of solar origin. The

    Dataset Structure / Content:
 
    The data files are ASCII tables of values. Included in the label
    file (*.LBL) is a header for each data table. The header gives the
    data processing time, requested time intervals, the actual time
    interval and livetime paramaters.
 
    Note that while the data files have widths of more than 80
    characters, the example data shown below has been wrapped in order
    to conform to a 80 character line limitation.

    Header Description:
 
    The first line of the header gives the Spacecraft, Instrument and
    Data processing time. The second line of the of the header gives the
    data processing input as 4 columns. The first two columns are
    start/stop volumes where a volume is number of 15 minute intervals
    from the start of 1989.  The last two columns are the start/stop
    time given in Spacecraft Event Time (UTC) computed from the
    start/stop volumes. Volumes times are provided in year and
    fractional day-of-year (DOY) format for the center time of the
    interval. In other words, you can compute the fractional DOY by the
    formula:
 
    DOY = [(VOLUME * 15) - 7.5] / (24 * 60)
 
    The third line of the header contains the actual values for the same
    start stop columns as the requested interval. The actual interval
    may be shorter than the resuested interval if data are not available
    for the entire requested interval. Line 4 is blank and lines 5-17
    give livetime parameters which are described in further detail
    below. Line 18 is blank, line 19 is column headings, and line 20 is
    a line of underscores.
 
    Livetime parameters are summarized as follows:
 
    Rate Counts - holds the total number of ions which triggered that
                  detector/buffer combination
    Times       - refers to number of seconds during which the buffer
                  was active
    PHA Counts  - is the number of ion event descriptions telemetered
                  via that buffer, and
    Livetimes   - are calculated from that info.
 
    Note that fractional livetime changes substantially during the
    flare interval, so that averaging is required. The absolute flux
    values are subject to an additional systematic uncertainty depending
    on the relevance of the averaging technique to the use of the flux
    values.
 
 
    Data Table description:
 
    Column  1: Element   - The name of the ion being described.
    Column  2: LET       - The identifier of the LET telescope, examples
                           show telescopes B and E.
    Column  3: Energy    - The energy center for the telescope during
                           its energy scan &lt;MeV/nucleon&gt;
    Column  4: Bandwidth - The width of the energy band around the
    Column  5: Doubles   - The number of ions stopping in detector LB2
                           in the given MeV/nucleon energy range
    Column  6: Triples   - For LET-B, the number of ions stopping in L3
                           in the given MeV/nucleon energy range.
                           For LET-E, the number of events triggering
                           L1 L2 L3 L4* L5* where * indicates a detector
                           that was  not-triggered.
    Column  7: WS.L1*    - a wide-stop (L1* L2 L3 L4 L5*) event which
                           did not hit L1.
    Column  8: WS.L1     - a wide-stop (L1 L2 L3 L4 L5*) event which did
                           hit L1.
    Column  9: Total     - Total number of events (sum of doubles and
                           triples).
    Column 10: Flux      - The calculated flux in units of
                           particles/cm^2-sr-sec-(MeV/Nuc).
    Column 11: Lower     - Statistical uncertainties in the flux value,
                           giving the lower limit of the 68% confidence
                           interval.
    Column 12: Upper     - Statistical uncertainties in the flux value,
                           giving the upper limit of the 68% confidence
                           interval.
    Column 13: Avg-LT    - Average livetime of the detector/buffer
                           combination
    Column 14: Geom-Fac  - Geometric factor /* Need more info here */
 
    Note:   -1 indicates that a measurement was not made and 0 indicates
              that no counts were detected,
            -999 means the column is not applicable for this detector.
 
    For LET B, the number of ions stopping in detector LB2 in the given
    MeV/nucleon Energy-range is listed in the Doubles column, and the
    ions stopping in LB3 are listed under Triples; the Total column sums
    the double and triple coincidence events. The calculated value for
    flux is given in the Flux column. Flux is given in units of
    particles/cm^2-sr-sec-(MeV/Nuc). Lower and Upper refer to the
    statistical uncertainties in flux values, giving the upper and lower
    limits of the 68% confidence interval. Avg-LT is the average live
    time of the detector/buffer combination, in seconds.
 
    For telescope LET E, the columns and refer to the same parameters
    as those previously mentioned for LET B, with the exceptions of
    columns triple, WS.L1*, and WS.L1. These headings refer to the
    different event types in this telescope: triple refers to an event
    triggering L1 L2 L3 L4* L5*, where an asterisk denotes a miss;
    WS.L1* categorizes a wide-stop (L2 L3 L4 L5*) event which did not
    hit L1; and WS.L1 indicates the wide-stop events which do trigger
    detector L1 (L1 L2 L3 L4* L5*).
