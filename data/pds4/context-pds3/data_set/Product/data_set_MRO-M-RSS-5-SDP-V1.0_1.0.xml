            This data set contains archival results from gravity
            investigations conducted during the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
            (MRO) mission. Radio measurements were made using the MRO
            spacecraft and Earth-based stations of the NASA Deep Space
            Network (DSN). The data set includes high-resolution spherical
            harmonic models of Mars&apos; gravity field generated by groups
            at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center,
            covariance matrices for some models, and maps for some models;
            these results were derived from raw radio tracking data. Updates
            to the archive may include derived line-of-sight acceleration
            profile.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
    The Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter (MRO) Gravity Archive Data Collection
    of Science Data Products (SDP) includes data products generated from
    radio occultation, gravity, and surface reflection investigations
    conducted by members of the MRO Gravity Team.
 
    Gravity SDPs include spherical harmonic models, maps or images
    of those models, and possibly line-of-sight acceleration profiles.
    Groups at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) under the
    direction of David Smith and at JPL under the direction of
    William Sjogren produced spherical harmonic models, maps, and images.
 
    The models are derived from a mix of data, including data from
    the missions of Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter. These spacecraft have different
    orbit characteristics (primarily mean periapse and apoapsis
    altitudes for these near-polar and near circular orbits)
    which determine their sensitivity to the Mars gravity field.
 
    The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was in an orbit with
    a periapse near 250 km and an apoapsis near 320 km. As with the
    other Mars mapping missions (Mars Global Surveyor
    and Mars Odyssey), periapsis was frozen over the South Pole.
    Aerobraking data are not including in these solutions since
    (a) There is usually no radio tracking of the spacecraft
    available through periapsis, and (b) the frequent firing
    of thrusters during the periapsis passes and the strong
    drag signal will mask any signal from Mars gravity.
 
    The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft remained operational
    from 1997 through 2005, spending the bulk of its time
    (after March 1999) in a low-altitude mapping orbit whose
    mean periapsis was 370 km and mean apoapsis was 420 to 430
    km. The Mars Odyssey spacecraft was in a similar orbit
    albeit with slightly higher altitude. An approximately
    two week segment of Mars Odyssey tracking data was
    obtained from the &apos;transition orbit&apos;, an orbit intermediate
    in orbit altitude mean the aerobraking altitude and
    the mapping orbit altitude, with a periapsis near 200 km
    and an apoapsis near 500 km.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      Spherical harmonic models are tables of coefficients GM, Cmn,
      and Smn -- as in equation (1) of [TYLERETAL1992].  These can
      be used to represent gravitational potential of Mars, for
      example.  Both ASCII (data type SHA) and binary (data type
      SHB) formats are defined, with the latter being preferred for
      large files which also include covariance terms.  Each file
      contains up to four tables: a header table containing general
      parameters for the model (gravitational constant, its
      uncertainty, degree and order of the field, normalization
      state, reference longitude, and reference latitude); a names
      table, giving the order in which coefficients appear; a
      coefficients table (degree m, order n, coefficients Cmn and
      Smn, and their uncertainties); and a covariances table giving
      the covariances of CijCmn, SijSmn, CijSmn, and SijCmn.
 
      Radio Science Digital Map files are image representations
      of gravity and other parameters.  Free air gravity, geoid,
      Bouguer anomaly, isostatic anomaly, and topographic values
      may be displayed using this data type.  Data are formatted
      as PDS image objects.
 
      The Line-of-Sight Acceleration Profile Data Record is a pair
      of PDS tables.  The first table contains header information
      such as time and observing geometry, parameters used in
      deriving acceleration from radio tracking measurements, and
      first-order Keplerian orbit elements.  The second table gives
      spacecraft acceleration versus time.  Also included at each
      time is the spacecraft position in planetocentric coordinates.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      Spherical harmonic models, maps, and line-of-sight acceleration
      profiles are derived from raw radio tracking data in several
      steps.
 
     The tracking data are processed in large orbit determination
     programs that integrate the equations of motion (DPODP at JPL
     [MOYER1971], and GEODYN at NASA GSFC [PAVLISETAL2007]), and
     model mathematically the radio science observables (ramped
     Doppler and range data).
     The observations are related to the geophysical parameters
     through the numerical integration and the detailed
     mathematical modeling of the radio science observables, and of
     all forces acting on the spacecraft trajectory, including
     planetary and third body gravity, solar radiation pressure,
     planetary radiation pressure, atmospheric drag, solid body tides,
     and relativity.
 
     The gravity field coefficients are obtained by accumulating
     normal equations from often hundreds of data arcs, and
     solving these systems of linear equations with thousands of unknowns.
     The unknowns include arc parameters, particular to one data arc (such
     as the spacecraft state, radiation pressure scale factors,
     atmospheric drag scale factors, etc.) and common parameters
     (such as the gravity coefficients, the planetary gravitational
     constant or GM, the Phobos and Deimos gravitational constants,
     and the Mars K2 Love number).
     Radio tracking data are processed in arcs delimited by
     propulsive maneuvers, occultations, etc.
 
     The Mars orbiting spacecraft perform regular
     angular momentum desaturation (AMD) maneuvers to remove the angular
     momentum that has accumulated in the spacecraft momentum
     wheels. On MRO, these AMD maneuvers occur usually every
     2-3 days, and arcs may be delimited by these maneuvers. AMD
     maneuvers on MGS and Mars Odyssey were much more frequent
     up to several times per day in some cases. In those circumstances
     the AMD&apos;s must be modeled in the orbit determination solution
     and solved for empirically along with the other orbital arc
     parameters. The times of the AMD&apos;s are specified in the
     small forces files (SFF) that are part of the MRO raw data
     archive.
 
      Maps of free air gravity and other quantities are generated from
      the spherical harmonic model(s) evaluated at regular grid
      points.
 
      Line-of-sight acceleration profiles are derived from single arcs
      of radio tracking data.  Doppler residuals with respect to a
      specific spherical harmonic model are spline-fitted; the splines
      are then differentiated analytically to obtain accelerations.
 
     Useful references which describe the procedures applied in
     general to processing Mars orbiter tracking data include
     [YUANETAL2001], [LEMOINEETAL2001], [KONOPLIVETAL2006].

    Coordinate System
    =================
   MRO Gravity SDP files use a Mars centered body-fixed coordinate
   system with positive east longitude.
 
   Gravity models are defined in the Mars coordinate system defined
   by [KONOPLIVETAL2006]. This coordinate system supersedes the
   IAU 1991 and IAU 2000 coordinate systems used for most previous
   Mars gravity models.
 
   See labels of specific gravity products for details.
 
    Software
    ========
      None.
 
 
    Media/Format

    Overview
    ========
      Data in this archive have been reduced as part of mission data
      analysis activities of the MRO Gravity Team.  Products of questionable
      validity have been flagged or omitted.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was reviewed by the MRO Gravity
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      Data set design, documentation, and sample products have passed
      a PDS peer review.
 
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data
      set, key elements of the archive were distributed for
      preliminary review.  These included electronic versions of
      example PDS labels, example data files, CATALOG files, and
      Software Interface Specifications.  These materials were
      distributed to PDS personnel, the experiment investigator,
      and others, as appropriate.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
      This volume contains gravity models and maps generated from Viking 1
      Lander, Pathfinder, MGS, Odyssey, and MRO data collected through
      the end of October 2008.  The Viking and Mariner 9 orbiter data were
      not included in this delivery as this data did not seem to any more
      information for the gravity field. The MRO data included tracking
      results from Transition Orbit and Mapping Orbit phases.  All useful
      MGS tracking data collected prior to the loss of the spacecraft in
      Nov. 2006 was used. Odyssey data included tracking data from
      Transition Orbit and Mapping Orbit phases.
