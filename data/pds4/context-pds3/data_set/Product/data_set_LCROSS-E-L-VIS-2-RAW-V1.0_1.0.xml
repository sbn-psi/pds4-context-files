    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    This data set contains context imagery from the visible
    light camera (VIS) on the LCROSS spacecraft.  The images
    in this dataset have targets named Moon, Earth and
    Calibration (i.e., not targeted).
 
    Each raw image file is a 24-bit RGB image, with a 720 x
    486 pixel format.  The image aspect ratio [H:V] is 1.33.
    The effective field-of-view [FOV] is 30.5 [H] x 22.8 [V]
    degrees.
 
    The time each image was captured is encoded in the
    image&apos;s filename like this:
 
      LCROSS_VIS_RAW_&lt;timestamp&gt;.IMG
 
    where &lt;timestamp&gt; = YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm
      and YYYY = the four digit year;
          MM = the two digit month,
          DD = the two digit day, and so on
          through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
 
    Detached labels for each image have the same filename as
    the image but with the &apos;LBL&apos; extension.
 
    Related Data Sets
    =================
 
    There is no dataset containing radiometrically
    calibrated images from this camera.  The field of view
    of this camera overlaps with the fields of view of all
    other instruments except Near Infrared Spectrometer #2
    (NSP2).
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
       Science
       -------
 
       There are no configurable parameters for the visible
       camera.
 
       Housekeeping
       ------------
 
       Instrument temperature at the image generation time
       is reported in the label file under:
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE, INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE_COUNT
       in degrees Centigrade and raw counts, respectively.
       This is a single telemetry point most representative
       of the camera chassis temperature for the image.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
    The detector produces 768 x 494, RGB images.  Each image
    was converted inside the camera to an analog, NTSC image
    and transmitted to the spacecraft.  The spacecraft
    multiplexed this camera with the two near-infrared
    cameras, receiving images from only one of these three
    cameras at a time.  When received, the spacecraft
    converted each NTSC image to a 720 x 486, 24-bit RGB
    digital image and compressed it using a lossy,
    proprietary, wavelet-based compression algorithm for
    downlink.
 
    On the ground, the images are decompressed and
    recompressed losslessly as RGB PNG files by GSEOS
    (Ground Support Equipment Operating System).  The LCROSS
    Make Archive program read these files, selected the Red
    channel, and wrote that as a three-channel,
    PDS-formatted (.IMG) file and a FITS file.
 
    Data
    ====
 
    These files are stored as PDS-formatted, three channel,
    8-bit MSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER files.  Each image file has a
    corresponding detached PDS label file sharing the same
    filename and an &apos;LBL&apos; filetype.
 
    The EXTRAS directory contains these images in FITS
    format as well.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    These images have been left in the camera&apos;s coordinate
    system.  These images need to be rotated +233 degrees to
    place them in the LCROSS Payload Common Camera
    Coordinate System.  A description of mapping the images
    with respect to each other and the S/C coordinate system
    is contained within the LCROSS Instrument Response and
    Calibration Report.
 
    Software
    ========
 
    The GSEOS Version used to generate these images is GSEOS
    5.2.407 (Feb 25, 2008), Python 2.2.3 (#37, Nov 28, 2003,
    04:20:20), Project Version 6.1.064.
 
    The LCROSS.py Python script used with GSEOS is Version
    Jun 11, 2008.
 
    The LCROSS Report Generator used on GSEOS created
    CCSDS.dat files is version 114.
 
    The LCROSS Make Archive program used to combine the
    output from GSEOS, LCROSS.py and LCROSS Report Generator
    to generate the PDS image and ASCII label files is
    dated 03/14/2010.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    The confidence level is unspecified.
 
    Review
    ======
 
    This LCROSS data set was reviewed internally by the
    LCROSS science team before delivery to PDS.  This data
    set has passed a PDS peer review.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    This dataset contains all images taken by LCROSS Visible
    Camera (VIS) during the mission, in raw form.  These
    images are in focus.
 
    Some images in this dataset contain image artifacts
    caused by interaction between the compression algorithm
    and the downlink.  This occurred during the PREIMPACT
    and IMPACT data collection periods because the size of
    the compressed images slightly exceeded the maximum
    CCSDS packet size.  This did not occur during any other
    data collection periods.  These compression artifacts
    are not flagged in the label files.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
 
    These images are not at the native detector resolution
    and accuracy because they have passed through an analog
    format before downlink.
 
    Digitizing the analog format on the spacecraft
    introduced edge pixels that must be clipped before
    computing image statistics.  This clipping is not done
    in this dataset.
 
    Saturated pixels are not flagged.
 
    The detector in this camera blumes significantly when
    overexposed.  This occurred during several data
    collection periods, particularly the EARTHLOOK
    calibration periods.  Images where this occurred are not
    flagged in the label files.
 
    Temporarily hot pixels due to cosmic ray strikes are not
    not flagged.
 
    Rarely, images were lost in decompression on the ground.
    No significant data was lost this way.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
 
    The raw visible camera images are compressed using a
    proprietary, wavelet-based compression algorithm onboard
    and decompressed on the ground.  This compression was
    lossy.  A version mismatch between compression /
    decompression implementations on the spacecraft and
    the ground resulted in rare failures to decompress an
    image.
