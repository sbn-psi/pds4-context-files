            This data set presents images and photometry of comet
            19P/Borrelly 1 obtained by Karen Meech over 20 nights during the
            period 1987-08-21 to 2002-02-03. These data were not of
            sufficient quality to be reviewed or formally ingested.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
    This data set presents 67 images of comet 19P/Borrelly 1 obtained by
    Karen Meech on 20 nights over the period 1987-08-21 to 2002-02-03.
    A separate table of aperture photometry derived from observations on
    three of those nights (1987-08-21, 1987-11-25 and 200-05-08) is
    included.
 
    Insufficient documentation and support were provided with these data
    to allow for external peer review or formal archiving.  The data are
    being saved in the hopes that this situation might change.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
    Most, but not all, of the images have been flattened and calibrated.
    The following information about the state of reduction of the images
    was provided with the data files:
 
      Date     # Images    Notes
      -------- --------    -----
      19870821     6       Photometry provided
      19870925    10       Need recalibration
      19871125     6       Photometry provided
      19880519     3       Need recalibration
      20000526     8       Need recalibration
      20000528     3       Photometry provided
      20010724     3       Photometry not calculated
      20010725     2       Photometry not calculated
      20010726     2       Photometry not calculated

      20010819     2       Need to be flattened
      20010820     2       Need to be flattened
      20010821     2       Need to be flattened
      20010822     2       Need to be flattened
      20010921     2       Photometry not calculated
      20010922     2       Photometry not calculated
      20010924     2       Photometry not calculated
      20010926     3       Photometry not calculated
      20010927     1       Photometry not calculated
      20020203     2       Photometry not calculated
 
 
 
    Modification History
    ====================
    The original FITS files and a photometry text file were provided to
    the SBN.  SBN personnel created PDS labels for the FITS files; the
    FITS headers have not been edited by SBN in any way.
 
    The photometry text file was converted to a flat ASCII data table
    and a PDS label provided.  The notes regarding state of reduction
    for the images were excluded from that data file and incorporated
    into the comments above.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    Note that the right ascensions and declinations included in the
    FITS headers and PDS labels are not all of the same epoch or
    equinox.  The epoch (and equinox, where it was included) noted
    in the FITS header has been carried into the PDS label with the
    unaltered coordinates.  Care should be taken in making comparisons
    based on right ascension and declination.
 
    PDS Labels
    ==========
    Several keywords were drafted to address questions and issues with
    these data that might arise in other data sets.  As of this writing
    (24 October 2005), these keywords have not been widely circulated or
    formally proposed for inclusion in the Planetary Data Dictionary. It
    is not clear whether they ever will be.  They remain in the labels,
    however, and their corresponding definitions included in this data
    set as documentation.
 
    These keywords are:
 
      CELESTIAL_CCOORDINATES_EPOCH
         Reference epoch for RA and declination
 
      CELESTIAL_COORDINATES_EQUINOX
         Equinox for quoted RA and declination
 
      RIGHT_ASCENSION_OFFSET
         Offset from some specified point, like the comet nucleus
 
      DECLINATION_OFFSET
         Offset from some specified point, like the comet nucleus
 
      OFFSET_DESCRIPTION
         Additional information about the offsets in RA and declination

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    Note that not all images are in the same state of reduction from
    night to night.  See the table in the data set description for a
    list of the state of each night&apos;s observations.
 
 
    Review
    ======
    This data set is scheduled for peer review in October-November 2005.
