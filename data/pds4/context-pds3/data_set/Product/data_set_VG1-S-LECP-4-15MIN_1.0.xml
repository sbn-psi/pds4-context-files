            THIS DATA SET CONSISTS OF RESAMPLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY
            CHARGED PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 1 WHILE THE
            SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF SATURN. THIS INSTRUMENT
            MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARGED PARTICLES (&gt;26 KEV
            ELECTRONS AND &gt;30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF
            DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL
            DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH
            THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CALIBRATED TO THE
            EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAGED TO ABOUT
            15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXACT BEGINNING AND ENDING
            TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE
            PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A
            ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF
            THE MEDIUM ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE
            TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS
            ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. THUS, THE FULL ANGULAR ANISOTROPY
            INFORMATION IS PRESERVED WITH THIS DATA. THE DATA IS IN THE FORM
            OF &apos;RATE&apos; DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO THE
            USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION WOULD
            DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMINATIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES OF
            THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES AND
            BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE STUDY
            OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT &apos;RATE&apos; TO
            &apos;INTENSITY&apos; FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE
            FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND
            CONTAMINATION AND SUBTRACT THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL.
            BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE
            OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2)
            DIVIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC
            FACTOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANDPASS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC
            FACTOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY &apos;channel_geometric_ factor&apos; AS
            ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL &apos;channel_id&apos;. TO DETERMINE
            THE ENERGY BANDPASS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF
            THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE
            ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES
            &apos;minimum_instrument_parameter&apos; and
            &apos;maximum_instrument_ parameter&apos; IN TABLE
            &apos;FPLECPENERGY&apos;, AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM
            &apos;ENERGY/NUCLEON&apos;. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES
            WITH THE DESIGNATIONS &apos;CH&apos; THESE BANDPASSES CAN BE USED
            ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE ACCEPTED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES
            &apos;minimum_instrument_parameter&apos; and
            &apos;maximum_instrument_ parameter&apos; IN TABLE
            &apos;FPLECPCHANZ&apos;, WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
            &apos;Z&apos; VALUE ACCEPTED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR
            ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANDPASS REFERS
            ONLY TO THE LOWEST &apos;Z&apos; VALUE ACCEPTED. THE BANDPASSES
            FOR OTHER &apos;Z&apos; VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE
            GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL
            PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH
            THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT
            TO SERIOUS CONTAMINATIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMINATIONS
            CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH
            HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS
            ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMINATION TYPES
            (&apos;contamination_id&apos; , &apos;contamination_desc&apos;)
            AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION (&apos;data_quality_id&apos;
            CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS &apos;data_quality_desc&apos;)
            BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME
            CORRECTION PROCEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT
            THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVERDRIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS
            PROCEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVERDRIVEN DETECTORS. A PROCEDURE
            IS AVAILABLE FOR CORRECTING VOYAGER 2 LECP ELECTRON CONTAMINATION
            OF LOW ENERGY ION CHANNELS, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN
            EVALUATED ONLY FOR THE URANUS DATA SET. THUS, CORRECTIONS HAVE
            BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE URANUS DATA SET. Also included with this
            data are one standard deviation statistical uncertainties for the
            directional data (sectors 1 through 8) expressed as a percent.
            Unknown values are generally coded as such, however in some
            instances the value will read &apos;zero&apos; when its status is
            unknown.

    Overview
    ========
      AT ALL TIMES DURING THIS PLANETARY ENCOUNTER THERE EXIST DATA
      IN THIS DATA SET THAT CAN BE RATED WITH THE HIGHEST CONFIDENCE
      LEVEL.  HOWEVER, SOME OF THE CHANNELS OF DATA ARE CONTAMINATED
      BY VARIOUS KINDS AND VARIOUS LEVELS OF CONTAMINATIONS.  IT IS
      THEREFORE IMPERATIVE, IN USING THIS DATA SET, THAT THE
      CONTAMINATION TABLES WITHIN THE CATALOG BE EXAMINED.  ALSO, NOT
      ALL KINDS OF CONTAMINATION HAVE BEEN FULLY DOCUMENTED.  WHEN IN
      DOUBT THE DATA SUPPLIER MUST BE CONTACTED.
