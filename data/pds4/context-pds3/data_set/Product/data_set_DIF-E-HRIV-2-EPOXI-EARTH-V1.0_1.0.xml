  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set set contains version 1.0 of raw narrow band filter
    images (350-950 nm) of Earth acquired by the Deep Impact High
    Resolution Visible CCD during the EPOCh phase of the EPOXI
    mission.  Three sets of observations were acquired on 18-19 March,
    28-29 May, and 4-5 June 2008 to characterize Earth as an analog for
    extrasolar planets.  Each observing period lasted approximately 24
    hours.  HRIV images were acquired once per hour with the filters
    centered on 350, 750 and 950 nm, whereas the 450-, 550-, 650-, and
    850-nm data were taken every 15 minutes.  During the observing period
    in May, the Moon transited across Earth as seen from the spacecraft.
 
    Additional Earth observations are being planned for the mission
    because two observing periods that were scheduled from late March
    through early May 2008 were canceled due to a telecommunications
    anomaly on board the spacecraft.  These data will be added to a
    future version of this data set.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and
    the image quality map are described in the Deep Impact instrument
    calibration document and the EPOXI SIS document included in this data
    set.  The SDC did not apply any type of correction or decompression
    algorithm to the raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw HRIV image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte of eight bit flags to indicate the quality of
      each pixel in the primary image.  The data label provides a short
      description of each bit.  For more information about the FITS primary
      image and its extension or for examples of how to access and use the
      quality flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document or the Deep Impact
      instrument calibration document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in a
      data label.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;HV&apos; identifies the HRIV
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 32
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 1000001, the
      first FITS file name would be HV08060416_1000001_001.FIT and the
      last would be HV08060416_1000001_032.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      Although raw data numbers for HRIV frames could be compressed on
      board the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table then downlinked,
      processed, and archived in the same format, Earth images acquired
      during the time period covered by this data set were never
      compressed.  Therefore the COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE keyword in the
      data labels is always set to &apos;UNCOMPRESSED&apos;.  For more information
      about this topic, see the image compression section of the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration documents.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS
      has a brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of HRIV to the Medium Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (MRI) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the relative boresight alignments section of the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw image data have units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      One HRIV image mode was used for all Earth observations:
 
                     X-Size  Y-Size
        Mode Name    (pix)   (pix)   Comments
        ---- ------  ------  ------  ---------------------------------------
          2  SF1       512    512    Sub-frame, shuttered
 
      All modes are unbinned.  For a thorough description of the imaging
      modes, please see the Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a
      brief discussion of this topic.
 
      Most image modes have a set of bias overclock rows and columns,
      located around the edges of the image array.  All overclock pixels
      were excluded from the calculation of the values for MINIMUM,
      MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in the data labels.  These
      overclock areas described in the Deep Impact instruments document
      and the Deep Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
    Filters
    -------
      A list of the characteristics of the HRIV filters used for the Earth
      observations is provided below.  For more information about the
      filters, see the Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep Impact
      instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a brief
      discussion of this topic.

    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For Earth observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      that were calculated for the time when the light arrived at the
      target and the earth-observer-to-target values that were calculated
      for the time when the light left the target.
 
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this data set
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However as
      this data set was being produced, the mission operations team
      figured out how to correct raw clock correlation data for the
      flyby spacecraft to allow timing fits that are accurate to at
      least the sub-second level.  The project plans to generate a
      complete, corrected set of correlations since launch.  This will
      ultimately result in a future version of a SCLK kernel that will
      retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI
      data.  When this kernel is available, it will be added to the
      SPICE data sets for the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE
      web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  NAIF used these kernels to produce the
    EPOXI SPICE data set, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels, unless specified otherwise (e.g,
    SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    data set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this data set were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set is archived at the PDS Small Bodies Node (SBN) and the
    Multi-Mission Archive at STScI (MAST).  It passed a peer review held
    by SBN on 23 July 2009; MAST personnel participated.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this data set.  All Earth observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Predicted observational geometry
    --------------------------------
      Some data products for the Earth observation on 28-29 May
      (2008/149-150) have geometry values based on predicted (estimated)
      pointing C-kernels found in the EPOXI SPICE archive.  Memory
      limitations on board the spacecraft caused some attitude information
      to be overwritten, and thus reconstructed (final and accurate)
      pointing data for part of this observing period were not generated
      nor available to the data pipeline .  However the EPOCh team
      provided a file of geometry from JPL Horizons that they used for
      analysis of the May Earth data.  See EPOCH_EARTH_GEOM_2008MAY.ASC
      located in the DOCUMENT/ directory of this data set.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in
      2005 indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  In-flight
      bakeouts during late February and early March 2005 reduced the
      defocus from about 1.0 cm to about 0.6 cm, resulting in a decrease
      in the width of stars from about 12 pixels to 9 pixels.  For more
      details, please see the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006] and the Deep Impact image
      restoration paper by Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the HRIV CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are biased during
      integration so that the centers of the two halves are apparently
      1/6 pixel closer to the center, and the two boundary rows show a
      decrease in sensitivity of 1/6.  Reconstructed image files space
      all lines evenly, so the true image is erroneously vertically
      pushed apart by 1/3 pixel at its center in these reconstructions.
      When making science measurements from HRIV images, one must
      therefore be very careful to properly account for the two flaws
      introduced by the apparently narrow central lines on the CCD - a
      geometric error that separates the image by an extra 1/3 pixel at
      the horizontal quadrant boundary, and 2) insertion of extra total
      radiance into calibrated images due to the flat-field correction,
      which corrects for an apparent radiance deficit in the two central
      rows because of the smaller number of photons actually incident on
      those rows.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document or the EPOXI SIS document.
