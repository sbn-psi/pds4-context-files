    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Mini-RF Calibrated Data Archive is a time-ordered
      collection of calibrated Level 2 SAR images collected by the
      Mini-RF instrument during the LRO mission to the Moon.
      They are provided in an oblique cylindrical map projection.
      They also contain stokes parameters files, polarization ratio
      files, a radar albedo file, and a browse image.
 
      Please see documentation in the DOCUMENT directory for
      additional information on the data files and their format.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      See individual SIS documents, which are located in the
      DOCUMENT directory, for detailed descriptions of each file
      contained in this data archive.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      The Level 2 burst mode data products are CDRs that the POC produces
      by ingesting the Level 1 CDRs into the Level 2 SAR processor.  The
      Level 2 CDRs differ from the Level 1 products in that they are
      orthorectified and are re-sampled into oblique cylindrical map
      projections.  The &apos;equator&apos; of the map projection will correspond to
      the line of longitude that the subspacecraft point crossed at the
      equator before the data collection.  A full PDS label accompanies each
      data file and gives a detailed description of the content and format.
 
    Data
    ====
      These data are stored in the DATA/SAR/&lt;orbit&gt;/LEVEL2 directory on
      archival volumes. File names are described in MRFLRO_DP_SIS.PDF.
 
      These products are map-projected calibrated single swath CDR image
      data.  The science products produced from data collected from the lunar
      polar regions are in an oblique cylindrical projection. Those produced
      from more equitorial regions are in an equirectangular projection.
      Each pixel is represented by two 4-byte floating point values and an
      8-byte complex value (one 4-byte floating point real and one 4-byte
      floating point imaginary value) for a total of 16 bytes per pixel.
      The first two numbers are the intensity images for H and V receive,
      respectively.  The complex value is the cross power intensity image
      between the H &amp; V receive.
 
      All Level 2 CDR image products are each accompanied by four stokes
      parameters files, a circular polarization ratio image, a same-sense
      polarization image and an opposite-sense polarization image. The
      Mini-RF transmits a right circular polarized signal,
      and receives Horizontal and vertical polarized signals, and the phase
      between the polarizations.  The Level 2 file consists of four pieces
      of information per pixel.  The received power on the horizontal
      polarization (ERH), the received power in the vertical polarization
      (ERV) and the real and imaginary portions of the cross product between
      the two polarization signals (Re ERH ERV* &amp; Im ERH ERV* ).
 
      The four stokes parameters (S1, S2, S3, and S4) are related to the
      data in the level 1 files by the following equations:
 
      S1   =   ERH + ERV
      S2   =   ERH - ERV
      S3   =   2 Re  ERH ERV*
      S4   =   -2 Im  ERH ERV*
 
      These data are stored in the DATA/SAR/&lt;orbit&gt;/LEVEL1 directory on
      archival volumes. File names are described in LRO_DP_SIS.PDF.
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      An extensive set of ancillary files is needed for proper
      analysis and interpretation of the derived data. Users
      should refer to the INDEX.TAB listing to locate ancillary files
      and to the Mini-RF data product SIS for data formats and
      naming conventions.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      The lunar body-fixed frame used by the Mini-RF investigation is
      referenced to the Moon Principle Axis (PA) coordinate system, as
      realized using NASA&apos;s SPICE products (Frames Kernel).
 
    Software
    ========
      No software is included with this archival data set.
 
    Media/Format
    ============
 
      These products are delivered on a hard-drive or by ftp and
      not on a specific formatted medium.

Overview
========
Data presented here are an accurate representation
of the Mini-RF data as received from the spacecraft, with no Doppler or
spatial processing.
 
Review
======
The Mini-RF EDR was reviewed internally by the Mini-RF team prior to release
to the PDS.  PDS also performed an external review of the Mini-RF EDR.
 
Data Coverage and Quality
=========================
Data reported are the minimally processed data received from the spacecraft
during five mission phases: Launch, Cruise, Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition,
Commissioning, and Exploration_Mission.  These mission phases are defined as:
 
    Start time               End time
    Phase Name               Date (DOY)               Date (DOY)
    -----------------        ----------------         ----------------
    LAUNCH                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        18 Jun 2009 (169)
    CRUISE                   18 Jun 2009 (169)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    LUNAR ORBIT ACQUISITION  23 Jun 2009 (174)        23 Jun 2009 (174)
    COMMISSIONING            23 Jun 2009 (174)        14 Sep 2009 (257)
    NOMINAL MISSION          15 Sep 2009 (258)        14 Sep 2010 (257)
    SCIENCE MISSION          15 Sep 2010 (258)        14 Sep 2012 (258)
 
No Mini-RF data were collected during Launch, Cruise, or
Lunar_Orbit_Acquisition phases. The Mini-RF collected data during each of
the other two mission phases. During these planned operational periods, the
Mini-RF functioned nominally and the data quality was good.
 
An S-Band receive calibration test was conducted on 20 August, 2009.  S-Band
transmit calibration tests were conducted on 22-23 August, 2009.  These
calibrations permit the characterization of both transmit polarization purity
as well as determining how precisely polarization can be measured by the
instrument.
 
Communications demonstration.  Mini-RF experiments to demonstrate half-duplex
communications were conducted on 16 August and 20 August, 2009.
 
The Mini-RF began collecting data over the lunar south polar region 13 July
2009 to support LCROSS targeting by characterizing the surfaces of
permanently shadowed regions.  This data collection phase continued until the
LCROSS impact on 9 October. 2009.
 
From Oct 14 through Dec. 17, Mini-RF was largely restricted to collecting
data over non-polar sites that lie equatorward of 63 degrees latitude North
and South.
 
Limitations
===========
This data set is minimally processed data.  The data are received from the
spacecraft telemetry, ingested into the LRO Missions Operations Center (MOC),
and then transferred to the APL Payload Operations Center (POC).
