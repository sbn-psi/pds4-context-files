    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    This data set contains imagery from the near-infrared
    camera #1 (NIR1) on the LCROSS spacecraft (S/C).  NIR1
    is a filtered camera sensitive from 1.4 to 1.7 microns.
 
    The images in this dataset have targets named Moon,
    Earth, Calibration (i.e., not targeted) and TestImage.
    Test images include ramps and camera initialization
    images that contain no science content.
 
    Each calibrated image file is a 32-bit PC_REAL greyscale
    image, with a 720 x 486 pixel format. The image aspect
    ratio [H:V] is 1.33. The effective field-of-view [FOV]
    is 28.3 [H] x 21.4 [V] degrees.
 
    The time each image was captured is encoded in the
    image&apos;s filename like this:
 
      LCROSS_NIR1_CAL_&lt;timestamp&gt;.IMG
 
    where &lt;timestamp&gt; = YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm
      and YYYY = the four digit year;
          MM = the two digit month,
          DD = the two digit day, and so on
          through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
 
    The detached label for each spectra has the same
    filename as the spectra but with the &apos;LBL&apos; extension.
 
    Related Data Sets
    =================
 
    NIR1_RAW (described in NIR1_RAW_DS.CAT) contains the raw
    versions of the images contained in this dataset of
    calibrated images.  The NIR2_RAW and NIR2_CAL datasets
    contain images from the other near-infrared camera.
    NIR2 had almost exactly the same field of view and was
    slightly more sensitive due to having no added filter.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
       Science
       -------
 
       After initialization, the near-infrared cameras were
       operated by setting two independent parameters:
 
       1. LCROSS:NIR_OPR (an integer [0, 15] inclusive)
          One of 16 operational configurations stored in
          non-volatile memory.  The factory default settings
          for these configurations were used.
 
          This setting determines the camera&apos;s integration
          time (in the labels as LCROSS:NIR_INTEGRATION_TIME
          in microseconds) and gain setting (LCROSS:NIR_GAIN
          in electrons per DN).
 
       2. LCROSS:ENHANCEMENT_MODE [OFF,ON]
          Image stretching.  Enabled only during the
          STARFIELD data collection period.
 
       These cameras have additional configuration settings
       that were redundant or kept constant and so are not
       noted in the labels.  The digital gain setting was
       always 1.  The effect of automatic gain control is to
       vary the OPR number, which is reported in the labels,
       so the automatic gain configuration is redundant.  In
       any case, this setting was off except for during the
       lunar swingby.  The Global Offset Value was always
       100 except during initialization where it was briefly
       set to 4095.  This parameter isn&apos;t noted in the
       labels, but all images where it was not 100 have a
       TARGET_NAME of TEST_IMAGE.
 
       Test images include ramps, all states high (white
       image), and all-states-low (flat dark image) and
       contain no science content.
 
       Housekeeping
       ------------
 
       Instrument temperature at the data collection time is
       reported in the label file under:
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE and
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE_COUNT in degrees Centigrade
       and raw counts, respectively.  This is a single
       telemetry point most representative of the
       instrument chassis temperature.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
    The detector produces 320 x 240, 12-bit grayscale
    images.  Each image was converted inside the camera to
    an analog, NTSC image and transmitted to the spacecraft.
    The spacecraft multiplexed the two near-infrared cameras
    with the visible light &apos;context&apos; camera, receiving
    images from only one of these three cameras at a time.
    When received, the spacecraft converted each NTSC image
    back to a 720 x 486, 24-bit RGB digital image and
    compressed it using a lossy, proprietary, wavelet-based
    compression algorithm for downlink.
 
    On the ground, the images are decompressed and
    recompressed losslessly as RGB PNG files by GSEOS
    (Ground Support Equipment Operating System).  The LCROSS
    Make Archive program read these files, selected the Red
    channel, and wrote that as a single-channel,
    PDS-formatted image (.IMG) file and a FITS file.
 
    Data
    ====
 
    These files are stored as 32-bit PC_REAL image
    files.  Each pixel&apos;s value is given as radiance units
    [W/m^2 sr].  Each image file has a corresponding
    detached PDS label file sharing the same filename and an
    &apos;LBL&apos; filetype.
 
    The EXTRAS directory contains these images in FITS
    format as well.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    These images have been left in the camera&apos;s coordinate
    system.  To convert them to the LCROSS Payload Common
    Camera Coordinate System, these images must be rotated
    +180 degrees.  A description of mapping the images with
    respect to each other and the S/C coordinate system is
    contained within the LCROSS Instrument Response and
    Calibration Report in the CALIB directory of this archive.
 
    Software
    ========
 
    The GSEOS Version used to generate these images is GSEOS
    5.2.407 (Feb 25, 2008), Python 2.2.3 (#37, Nov 28, 2003,
    04:20:20), Project Version 6.1.064.
 
    The LCROSS.py Python script used with GSEOS is Version
    Jun 11, 2008.
 
    The LCROSS Report Generator used on GSEOS created
    CCSDS.dat files is version 114.
 
    The version of Satellite Toolkit used to prepare geometric
    information for the labels is 8.1.3.
 
    The LCROSS Make Archive program used to assemble the
    PDS-formatted submission is dated 03/14/2010.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    The confidence level is unspecified.
 
    Review
    ======
 
    This LCROSS data set was reviewed internally by the
    LCROSS science team before delivery to PDS.  This data
    set has passed a PDS peer review.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    This dataset contains all images taken by LCROSS
    Near-Infrared Camera #1 (NIR1) during the mission, in
    calibrated form.  These images are in focus.
 
    The images in this dataset do not have image artifacts
    caused by compression.  Images from the Visible Camera
    (VIS) did contain compression artifacts (see
    VIS_RAW_DS.CAT), and the NIR1 camera used the same
    datapath and compression hardware within the spacecraft.
    However this problem did not occur with any NIR1 images
    due to their lower dynamic range when in NTSC format.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
 
    These images are not at the native detector resolution
    and accuracy because they have passed through an analog
    format before downlink.
 
    Digitizing the analog format on the spacecraft
    introduced edge pixels that must be clipped before
    computing image statistics.  This clipping is not done
    in this dataset nor in the raw dataset (NIR1_RAW).
 
    Saturated pixels are flagged as out-of-range values,
    however, the presence of these pixels is not flagged in
    the label files.
 
    The detector in this camera blumes significantly when
    overexposed.  This occurred during several data
    collection periods, including the PREIMPACT, IMPACT and
    EARTHLOOK periods.  Images where this occurred are not
    flagged in the label files.
 
    Temporarily hot pixels due to cosmic ray strikes are not
    not flagged.
 
    Rarely, images were lost in decompression on the ground.
    No significant data was lost this way.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
 
    The raw near-infrared camera images are compressed using
    a proprietary, wavelet-based compression algorithm
    onboard and decompressed on the ground.  This
    compression was lossy.  A version mismatch between
    compression / decompression implementations on the
    spacecraft and the ground resulted in rare failures to
    decompress an image.
