            Payload Checkout 8 (PC8) was an active checkout where a target
            independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and
            request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload t
            All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario.The Active Payl
            Checkout 8 ran for 2 consecutive days (05-06 July2008) plus 26
            consecutive days starting on the 9th July 2008 until the 1st A
            2008. This is approximately twice the allocated time of the ac
            PC6 scenario that preceded it. PC8 consists of two pha similar to
            the previous Passive Payload Checkouts the 2nd phas an active
            test; GD02 is a Non nominal operational configuratio test (Only
            Impact Sensor operational and cover closed), in GD0 we have
            successfully tested a non-standard configuration, in was a test
            to investigate interference from other instruments. Redundant
            I/Fs in sequence and executing similar procedures fo two cases.
            GD02, GD03 and GD_INT were executed only on Main I/ ADC counts to
            engineering values. The quality of the Housekeeping and
            Calibration data is good. Scientific data are due to noise, as no
            grain event is expected during this mission phase. These data
            must be only considered to evaluate GIADA behaviour and not as
            real scientific data. Data reported by GDS and IS are due to
            noise as no dust event is expected during this mission phase. MBS
            frequency changes, once normalized for frequency vs. temperature
            dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants
            existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and Calibration
            data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument
            health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired
            during other mission phases.

        The format of data reported in GIADA data sets is the same
        for all mission phases. Data reported by GDS and IS are due
        to noise as no dust event is expected in this mission phase.
        MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs.
        temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of
        contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping
        and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to
        evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with
        similar data acquired during other mission phases.

        The data reported in this data set have been converted from
        ADC counts to engineering values. The quality of the
        Housekeeping and Calibration data is good. Scientific data
        are due to noise, as no grain event is expected during this
        mission phase. These data must be only considered to evaluate
        GIADA behaviour and not as real scientific data.

        (reported in DOCUMENTation dir) for evaluations on GIADA
        behaviour during this mission phase.
