  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains version 1.0 of calibrated, 1.05- to 4.8-micron
    spectra of Earth acquired by the High Resolution Infrared Spectrometer
    (HRII) during the EPOCh phase of the EPOXI mission.  Three sets of
    observations were acquired on 18-19 March, 28-29 May, and 4-5 June
    2008 to characterize Earth as an analog for extrasolar planets.  Each
    observing period lasted approximately 24 hours, and spectra were
    acquired twice per hour.  During the observing period in May, the Moon
    transited across Earth as seen from the spacecraft.
 
    At every half hour of each observing period, the spacecraft slewed
    across the Earth while the IR spectrometer recorded data; these
    scans were performed three times within several minutes, alternating
    direction from south-to-north and north-to-south.  Each scan
    consisted of eight 128x256 binned subframes.  Each half-hour set
    alternated between slower scans with longer frame exposure times
    and faster scans with shorter frame durations.
 
    Additional Earth observations are being planned for the mission
    because two observing periods that were scheduled from late March
    through early May 2008 were canceled due to a telecommunications
    anomaly on board the spacecraft.  These data will be added to a
    future version of this data set.

  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial/along-slit) FITS
    spectral images and PDS labels in this data set were generated by the
    Deep Impact/EPOXI calibration pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s
    Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.  For HRII spectra, the
    pipeline generates two types of calibrated products:
 
      - Uncleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RADREV&apos;.  The RADREV data are considered to be reversible
        because the calibration steps can be backed out to return to the
        original, raw data numbers.
 
      - Irreversibly cleaned radiance data provided in units of
        Watts/(meter**2 steradian micron) and identified by the mnemonic
        &apos;RAD&apos;.  The RAD data are considered to be irreversible because
        the calibration steps, such as smoothing over bad pixels, cannot
        easily be backed out to return to the original, raw data
        numbers.
 
    The calibration pipeline performed the following processes on the raw
    HRII FITS data to produce the RADREV and RAD products found in this
    data set:
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS header
      - Decompression of compressed images (Earth spectra were not
        compressed)
      - Linearization of raw data numbers
      - Subtraction of dark noise
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk (a unit correction)
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration that is reversible (RADREV)
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels identified in the
        RADREV data to make a partially cleaned, irreversible, radiometric
        calibration with units of radiance (RAD);  Steps for despiking
        (i.e., cosmic ray removal) and denoising the data which are part
        of the RAD stream were not performed because the existing routines
        are not robust.
 
        ** A flat-field correction was not applied because the process
           in this version of the calibration pipeline is not adequate.
 
    As part of the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension, to identify:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated,
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated,
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information, and
      - Pixels considered to be anomalous as indicated by bad pixel
        maps (missing pixels were identified when the raw FITS files
        were created).
 
    The pipeline also created FITS image extensions for a spectral
    registration (wavelength) map, a spectral resolution (bandwidth) map,
    and a signal-to-noise ratio map.  The calibration steps and files
    applied to each raw image are listed in the PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT
    keyword in the PDS data label.  For a detailed discussion of the
    calibration pipeline and the resulting data, see the Deep Impact
    instrument calibration document and the EPOXI SIS document.
 
    The calibrated spectra in this data set were the best available data
    as of February 2009.  There are known deficiencies for spectra from
    the Deep Impact mission that are also relevant to the EPOXI Earth
    spectra in this data set.  The HRII calibration limitations document
    describes these limitations.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each calibrated spectral image is stored as FITS.  The primary
      data unit contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the
      fastest varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from
      about 1.05 to 4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding
      to the spatial or along-slit dimension.  The primary image is
      followed by four image extensions that are two-dimensional
      pixel-by-pixel maps providing additional information about the
      spectral image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data label defines the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides the spectral registration or
          wavelength for each pixel in the primary image.  This
          extension is required because the wavelength for each
          pixel changes as the temperature of the instrument
          increased or decreased.
 
        - The third extension provides the spectral bandwidth for
          each pixel in the primary image.  This extension is
          required because the bandwidth for each pixel changes as
          the temperature of the instrument increased or decreased.
 
        - The fourth extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      For more information about the FITS primary image and the extensions,
      refer to the Deep Impact instrument calibration document or the EPOXI
      SIS document
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in a
      data label.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HIyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where &apos;HI&apos; identifies the HRII
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID, and
      rr identifies the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (reversibly calibrated, radiance units)
        R  for RAD data (partially cleaned RADREV data, radiance units)
 
      Up to 999 individual images can be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Spectral scans often had 32 or more frames for one specific exposure.
      Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially increasing
      frame number within an exposure ID and corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in
      the data labels.  For example, if 32 frames were commanded for a scan
      with an exposure ID of 1000001, the first FITS file name would be
      HI08060416_1000001_001_RR.FIT and the last would be
      HI08060416_1000001_032_RR.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      All data products in this data set are uncompressed.  If the
      associated raw data products was compressed on board the flyby
      spacecraft (and thus received on the ground and archived as
      compressed) then the calibration pipeline uses one of four 8-bit
      lookup tables to decompress the raw image.  However, the Earth
      spectra acquired acquired during the time period covered by this data
      set were never compressed.  For more information about this topic,
      see the image compression section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration documents.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS
      has a brief discussion of this topic.

      Each IR scan across the Earth consists of multiple frames within
      one exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in the data labels).  To work with
      these spectral scans, it is recommended that all frames for one
      exposure ID be stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a
      spatial-spatial map can be produced for a specific wavelength by
      selecting the appropriate spectral column from the image cube.
      Spectral wavelengths are provided by the second FITS extension,
      the spectral registration (wavelength) map.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      For a comparison of the relative locations of the IR slit with
      respect to the fields of view of the Medium Resolution Instrument
      Visible CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV), see the relative boresight alignments section of the
      Deep Impact instrument calibration document.
 
 
    Timing for Spectra
    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction
      is vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out
      from the left and right edges and toward the center and starting
      with the first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at
      the top of the display.  Since the detector is reset and read out
      on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at
      which each pixel is exposed, although each pixel has the same
      exposure duration.  Additionally, the end of the spectrometer slit
      that always points roughly towards the sun is the first line to be
      readout and the last line to be read out is furthest from the sun,
      assuming the spacecraft is in its usual orientation with the solar
      pointing roughly toward the sun.  For more information about the
      timing of the spectra, see the IR focal plane and quadrant
      nomenclature sections of the Deep Impact instrument calibration
      document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Calibrated RADREV and RAD spectral images have units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      One HRII image mode was used for all Earth spectra:
 
                    X-Size  Y-Size  Bin
        Mode Name   (pix)   (pix)  Type  Comments
        ---- ------ ------  -----  ----- ---------------------------------
          2  BINSF1   512     126   2x2  Binned sub-frame
 
      In the table above, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is
      the spatial dimension.  For a thorough description of the imaging
      modes, please see the Deep Impact instruments document or the Deep
      Impact instrument calibration document.  Also the EPOXI SIS has a
      brief discussion of this topic.
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      For Earth observations, sub-spacecraft and sub-solar longitude and
      latitude coordinates (planetocentric, body-fixed rotating) are
      provided, when available, in the data labels by
      SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE, SUB_SPACECRAFT_LATITUDE,
      SUB_SOLAR_LONGITUDE, and SUB_SOLAR_LATITUDE.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      that were calculated for the time when the light arrived at the
      target and the earth-observer-to-target values that were calculated
      for the time when the light left the target.
 
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this data set
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However as
      this data set was being produced, the mission operations team
      figured out how to correct raw clock correlation data for the
      flyby spacecraft to allow timing fits that are accurate to at
      least the sub-second level.  The project plans to generate a
      complete, corrected set of correlations since launch.  This will
      ultimately result in a future version of a SCLK kernel that will
      retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep Impact and EPOXI
      data.  When this kernel is available, it will be added to the
      SPICE data sets for the two missions and posted on the NAIF/SPICE
      web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  NAIF used these kernels to produce the
    EPOXI SPICE data set, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels, unless specified otherwise (e.g,
    SUB_SPACECRAFT_LONGITUDE).
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this data set are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    data set.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data files in this data set were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set is archived at the PDS Small Bodies Node (SBN) and the
    Multi-Mission Archive at STScI (MAST).  It passed a peer review held
    by SBN on 23 July 2009; MAST personnel participated.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this data set.  All Earth observations
    received on the ground were processed and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Predicted observational geometry
    --------------------------------
      Some data products for the Earth observation on 28-29 May
      (2008/149-150) have geometry values based on predicted (estimated)
      pointing C-kernels found in the EPOXI SPICE archive.  Memory
      limitations on board the spacecraft caused some attitude information
      to be overwritten, and thus reconstructed (final and accurate)
      pointing data for part of this observing period were not generated
      nor available to the data pipeline .  However the EPOCh team
      provided a file of geometry from JPL Horizons that they used for
      analysis of the May Earth data.  See EPOCH_EARTH_GEOM_2008MAY.ASC
      located in the DOCUMENT/ directory of this data set.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in 2005
      indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus
      problem does not significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more
      details, please see the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen,
      et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels are included in the calibrated
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically, it
      is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM keywords in
      the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS header) be
      used to scale an image for display because these values exclude the
      header bytes as well as the reference rows and columns located around
      the edge of the spectral image.  For more information, see the
      quadrant nomenclature section of the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document or the EPOXI SIS document.
