            Abstract ======== The MESSENGER MDIS DEMs are derived products. A
            DEM is a gridded (raster) product that records elevation values
            of a given terrain in each pixel. Corresponding metadata include
            map projection information so pixels can be associated with
            latitude and longitude. Values are measured relative to the
            planetary geoid reference radius of 2,439.4 km (i.e. elevation).
            Generally, the MESSENGER DEM products described here are derived
            from MESSENGER MDIS image data. The DEMs are typically derived
            using stereo photogrammetry (i.e., stereo pairs or sets)
            techniques. The primary PDS product is a DEM provided in both PDS
            image (.IMG) and JPEG 2000 (.JP2) format files. Associated with
            some of the DEM products is a list of lower-level MDIS products
            provided either as an accompanying table (*.TAB) file or as text
            (*.TXT) files in the EXTRAS directory.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The data set consists of digital elevation models (DEM) of Mercury
      produced by several institutions participating in the MESSENGER mission.
      Each DEM data producer applies different techniques to derive their
      products.  The SIS describes each technique in detail.
 
      The data set contains several global DEM products and some specially
      selected regional DEM products.  Each product are gridded map
      projections of various resolutions and provided in PDS compliant IMG
      format.These gridded map products may contain interpolated values at
      some grid points. Those process by which each product is created is
      described in the SIS.
 
      Global map products are provided in simple cylindrical projections where
      the raster image extends from 0 to 360 degrees positive east longitudes
      in the sample direction and -90 to 90 degrees latitude extents from
      bottom  to top in the line direction. Polar stereographic projections
      are provided for both the north and south poles. These projections are
      square images that extend from 65 degrees latitude poleward where the
      four centermost pixels surround the pole.  Resolutions vary by product.
 
      Regional DEM products that highlight certain features on Mercury&apos;s
      surface were selected by team members.  These products are provided in
      equirectangular projection with postive east longitudes. Longitude and
      resolution ranges vary by product.
 
      Dataset projections are given in DEM_EQU_MAP.CAT and DEM_POLAR_MAP.CAT.
 
      Geospatially labelled, JPEG 2000 format products accompany the USGS and
      DLR DEMs. GeoTIFF format products in the EXTRAS directory accompany the
      ASU DEMs. PDS compliant .LBL files accompany each JPEG 2000
      file. Supporting .XML files accompany the USGS JPEG 2000 products from
      which pixel level information can be read using an appropriate reader.
      The data providers do not provide support for commercially available
      data analysis products.  No internally produced software for the
      visualization or interpretation of data products is provided.
 
      The file names developed for this PDS archive are restricted to a
      maximum 36-character base name and 3 character extension name with
      a period separating the file and extension names.  Also known as
      the &apos;36.3&apos; format, this is compliant with the ISO 9660 Level 2
      specification (maximum of 40 characters), which is required by PDS.
