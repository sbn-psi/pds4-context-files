  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains version 2.0 of calibrated spectral images of
    comet 9P/Tempel 1 acquired by the Deep Impact High Resolution
    Instrument Infrared Spectrometer (HRII) during the encounter phase of
    the mission.  Version 2.0 includes uncleaned and cleaned radiance data
    with improved calibration and geometry.  The data were collected from
    20 June through 6 July 2005.  Spectra taken before June 20, 2005, are
    not included in this data set because the spectrometer was not
    pointing at the target.
 
    A summary of the comet observations in this data set is provided here:

      DI-C-SPICE-6-V1.0                       : SPICE kernels
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    The calibrated two-dimensional (wavelength and spatial) FITS image
    spectra in this data set were generated by the Deep Impact calibration
    pipeline, maintained by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at
    Cornell University.  For these data (version 2.0), the method for dark
    subtraction was revised which improved the calibration of the area
    under the anti-saturation filter by about 10%.  New, time-dependent
    bad pixel maps were utilized, and the geometry was improved because
    the final kernels from the Deep Impact SPICE archive were used.
 
    The pipeline performed the following reduction and calibration steps
    to produce the two types of spectral images (uncleaned and cleaned
    radiance) in this data set:
 
      - Calibration of temperatures and voltages in the FITS headers
      - Decompression of compressed images
      - Linearization of raw data numbers
      - Subtraction of dark noise
      - Removal of electronic cross-talk (a unit correction)
      - Conversion of data numbers to units of radiance for an absolute,
        radiometric calibration (&apos;RADREV&apos;)
      - Interpolation over bad and missing pixels for partially cleaned,
        radiometric calibration (&apos;RAD&apos;); Cosmic rays were not removed
        because the existing calibration routine was not robust
 
    The flat-field correction was not reliable and was not applied during
    the calibration process.
 
    The uncleaned radiance data, designated by the mnemonic &apos;RADREV&apos;,
    were provided in units of radiance as Watts/(meter**2 steradian
    micron) and were considered reversible because the calibration steps
    could be removed to get back to the original, raw data numbers.
    The irreversibly cleaned radiance data, designated by the mnemonic
    &apos;RAD&apos;, were provided in units of radiance as Watts/(meter**2
    steradian micron).  Only the RADREV data were included in version
    1.0 of this data set.
 
    During the calibration process, the pipeline updated the
    pixel-by-pixel image quality map, the first FITS extension,
    to identify the following types of pixels:
 
      - Pixels where the raw value was saturated
      - Pixels where the analog-to-digital converter was saturated
      - Pixels that were ultra-compressed and thus contain very little
        information
      - Pixels considered bad as indicated by bad pixel maps (missing
        pixels were identified when the raw FITS files were created)
 
    The pipeline also created FITS image extensions for a spectral
    registration (wavelength) map, a spectral resolution (bandwidth)
    map, and a signal-to-noise ratio map.  The calibration steps and
    files used to reduce each raw image are listed in the
    PROCESSING_HISTORY_TEXT keyword in the PDS data label for that
    image.  For a detailed discussion of the calibration pipeline and
    the resulting data, see the instrument calibration document by
    Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].
 
    The reduced spectra were the best available data as of September
    2006. There are known deficiencies for these spectra which are
    discussed in the HRII calibration limitations document included
    on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
    Applied Coherent Technology Corporation in Herndon, VA, produced the
    PDS data labels by extracting parameters from the FITS headers.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the data labels and FITS files is
      HIcccccccccc_eeeeeee_nnn_rr.LBL or FIT where cccccccccc is the
      spacecraft clock count at the mid-point of the observation and
      eeeeeee is the exposure ID (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels).  Up to
      999 individual images could be commanded for one exposure ID.
      Spectral scans often had 32 or more frames for one specific
      exposure.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the sequentially
      increasing frame number within an exposure ID and corresponds to
      IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 32 frames were
      commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 9009001, the first FITS
      file name would be HIcccccccccc_9009001_001_RR.FIT and the last
      would be HIcccccccccc_9009001_032_RR.FIT.  Finally, rr identifies
      the type of reduction:
 
        RR for RADREV data (radiance units, reversible)
        R  for RAD data (radiance units, partially cleaned)
 
 
    Spectral Images
    ---------------
      The infrared spectral data were stored as FITS.  The primary data
      array contains the two-dimensional spectral image, with the fastest
      varying axis corresponding to increasing wavelengths from 1.05 to
      4.8 microns and the slowest varying axis corresponding to the
      spatial dimension. Each FITS file includes four image extensions
      that are two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel maps the provide additional
      information about the spectral (primary) image:
 
        - The first extension uses one byte of eight, bit flags to
          describe the quality of each pixel in the primary image.
          The PDS data labels define the purpose of each bit.
 
        - The second extension provides the spectral registration or
          wavelength for each pixel in the primary image.  This
          extension was required because the wavelength for each
          pixel changed as the temperature of the instrument
          increased or decreased.
 
        - The third extension provides the spectral bandwidth for
          each pixel in the primary image.  This extension was
          required because the bandwidth for each pixel changed as
          the temperature of the instrument increased or decreased.
 
        - The fourth extension provides a signal-to-noise ratio for
          each pixel in the primary image.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS label.  For more
      information about the FITS primary image and the extensions, refer
      to the instrument calibration document included on the Deep Impact
      Documentation volume.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      A summary of the imaging modes is provided below.  For a thorough
      description of the modes, please see the Deep Impact instrument
      paper by Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] included on the
      Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
                     X-Size  Y-Size   Bin
        Mode Name    (pix)   (pix)   Type  Comments
        ---- ------  ------  ------  ----- -------------------------------
          1  BINFF     512     256    2x2  Binned full frame
          2  BINSF1    512     126    2x2  Binned sub-frame
          3  BINSF2    512      64    2x2  Binned sub-frame

                                           time is 1/2 of mode 1)
 
       In this table, X-Size is the spectral dimension and Y-Size is the
       spatial dimension.
 
 
    Compression
    -----------
      All data files in this data set were uncompressed.  If the
      associated raw data file was compressed on board the flyby
      spacecraft (and thus received on the ground and archived as
      compressed) then the calibration pipeline used one of four lossy
      lookup tables to decompress raw image.  For information about data
      compression, see the Deep Impact instruments document by Hampton,
      et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] or the instrument calibration
      paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006] included on the
      Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
 
    True-Sky &apos;As Seen By Observer&apos; Display
    ----------------------------------------
      A true-sky view is achieved by displaying the image using the
      standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying axis (samples)
      increasing to the right in the display window and the slowest-
      varying axis increasing to the top.  This convention is also
      defined in the PDS data labels:
 
        SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION = RIGHT
        LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION   = UP
 
      The direction to Celestial North and Ecliptic North, measured
      clockwise from the top of the displayed image, is provided in PDS
      labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE and
      SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE, both of which assume the correct
      display defined by SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.
 
      Using this convention to display an approach image of Tempel 1,
      ecliptic North is toward the right and the Sun is down.  After
      impact, the Flyby spacecraft came out of shield mode and turned
      around to lookback at the comet.  For lookback images, ecliptic
      North is toward the left, and the Sun is down.
 
 
    Spectral Scans
    --------------
      Nearly all exposures of Tempel 1 during encounter were scans across
      the nucleus or the coma, and these are identified in the HRII
      encounter pointing summary document.  To make scans, the spacecraft
      was slewed while the IR detector recorded data.  To work with
      spectral scans, it is recommended that all frames for one exposure
      ID be stacked into a three-dimensional cube.  Then, a
      spatial-spatial map can be produced for a specific wavelength by
      selecting the appropriate spectral column from the image cube.
      Spectral wavelengths are provided by the second FITS extension, the
      spectral registration (wavelength) map.
 
      Several exposures from encounter were stares, where the spectrometer
      was pointed at a specific target location for the duration of the
      exposure.  Exposure IDs that were stares are also identified in the
      HRII encounter pointing summary document included on the Deep Impact
      Documentation volume.
 
 
    IR Slit Location
    ----------------
      For a comparison of the relative locations of the IR slit with
      respect to the fields of view of the Medium Resolution Instrument
      CCD (MRI) and the High Resolution Instrument CCD (HRI), see the
      relative boresight alignments section of the instrument calibration
      document.  To visually inspect where the IR slit was estimated to be
      on the nucleus of Tempel 1 during impact and lookback, see the
      HRII/HRIV context maps included on the Deep Impact Documentation
      volume.
 
 
    Timing for Spectra
    ------------------
      It is important to note that the readout order of the IR detector
      affects the timing of the spectra.  When a HRII spectral image is
      displayed using the true-sky convention, the wavelength increases
      horizontally to the right and the spatial or along-slit direction is
      vertical.  In this orientation, the IR detector was read out from
      the left and right edges and toward the center and starting with the
      first row at the bottom and ending with the last row at the top of
      the display.  Since the detector was reset and read out on a
      pixel-by-pixel basis, the read out order affects the time at which
      each pixel was exposed, although each pixel had the same exposure
      duration.  For more information about the timing of the spectra, see
      the IR focal plane and quadrant nomenclature sections of the
      instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Reduced RADREV and RAD data are in units of radiance,
      W/(m**2 steradian micron).
 
 
    Time-Related Keywords
    ---------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_RECEIVED_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should be able to see an event recorded by
      the instrument.
 
      The TIME_FROM_IMPACT_VALUE keyword in the data labels was based
      on the best estimate of the time of impact based on the clock
      onboard the flyby spacecraft was UTC 05:44:34.265 on 4 Jul 2005.
      The analysis that lead to this estimate is discussed in the
      spacecraft clock correlation document included on the Deep Impact
      Documentation volume.
 
 
    Geometry-Related Keywords
    -------------------------
      The SOLAR_NORTH_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE in the data labels specified the
      the direction of ecliptic north as projected onto the image plane.
      It is measured from the &apos;upward&apos; direction, clockwise to the
      direction toward ecliptic north when the image is displayed as
      defined by the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION
      keywords.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the
      proper geometric information for the target of choice in many
      cases.  When these parameters could not be computed, the
      corresponding keywords in the PDS data labels were set to a
      value of unknown (UNK).  Geometry-related keywords for most
      calibration targets were set to UNK.
 
      Geometric parameters provided in the data labels were computed at
      the epoch specified by MID_IMAGE_TIME, except for the target-to-sun
      and earth-observer-to-target parameters.  Target-to-sun values were
      calculated for the time when the light left the sun while
      earth-observer-to-target were calculated for the time when the light
      left the target.
 
      Geometry-related parameters in the PDS data labels are uncertain at
      a level of a few seconds because of a known 2-second discrepancy
      between the clocks on board the flyby and impactor spacecraft and
      between in-situ data and ground-based observations.  After a
      detailed analysis of the timing problem in early 2006, improved
      self-consistent SPICE kernels were generated by the Deep Impact
      project to correlate the spacecraft clocks; there is still a
      1-2 second uncertainty between the in-situ data and the ground-
      based observations and an uncertainty of about one half of a
      second between the clocks on the flyby and impactor spacecraft.
      These improved kernels were included in the DI SPICE data set
      and were used to calculate the geometric parameters in the PDS
      data labels.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
      see the spacecraft clock correlation report provided on the DI
      documentation volume, DIDOC_0001.
 
      The SPICE kernels used to calculated the geometric parameters are
      provided by the SPICE_FILE_NAME keyword in the PDS data labels.  The
      kernels were listed in the order they were loaded into memory for
      processing.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    Geometric parameters included in the data labels were computed using
    the final version of the kernel files archived in the Deep Impact
    SPICE data set.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) was the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set, version 2.0, replaces version 1.0 that was delivered
    to PDS in December 2005.
 
    As noted above, the geometry-related parameters in the PDS data
    labels are uncertain at a level of a few seconds because of a known
    2-second discrepancy between the clocks on board the flyby and
    impactor spacecraft and between in-situ data and ground-based
    observations.  For more information about this discrepancy, please
    see the spacecraft clock correlation report included on the Deep
    Impact Documentation volume.
 
    The FITS files in this data set were reviewed internally by the Deep
    Impact project and were used extensively by the science team.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This data set was peer-reviewed in April 2007 and was accepted
    for the PDS archive pending resolution of liens (completed in July
    2007).
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no gaps in this data set.  All raw spectral images of
    Tempel 1 that were received on the ground were successfully reduced
    and included in this data set.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.
    For more information, refer to the notes about image quality map in
    the PDS data label or to the instrument calibration document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Known Deficiencies for the IR Calibration
    -----------------------------------------
      There are known deficiencies with the version of the IR calibration
      pipeline that reduced these data.  The deficiencies are discussed in
      the HRII calibration limitations document included on the Deep
      Impact Documentation volume.  Given these deficiencies, the most
      reliably calibrated pixels are outside the anti-saturation filter
      and between 2.0 and 4.6 microns.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Early images of stars using the HRI visible CCD indicated the HRI
      telescope was out of focus.  However, this focus problem did not
      significantly affect the HRII instrument.  For more details, please
      see the instrument calibration paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006)
      [KLAASENETAL2006] included on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software overwrote the first 50 uncompressed (or 100
      compressed) pixels of first quadrant read out from the instrument
      with an image header.  These header pixels were included in the
      reduced FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary
      dramatically, it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and
      MAXIMUM keywords in the PDS data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL
      in the FITS header) be used to scale an image for display because
      these values exclude the header bytes as well as the reference
      rows and columns located around the edge of the spectral image.
      The location of the header pixels in a displayed FITS image
      depends on the readout order of the instrument, as discussed in
      the quadrant nomenclature section of the instrument calibration
      paper included on the Deep Impact Documentation volume.
