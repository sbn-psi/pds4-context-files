  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe proxy
    electron density data set contains electron densities derived using an
    empirical relation between the floating  potential and electron densities
    from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer during the entire Cassini mission.
    This dataset also includes the spacecraft potential which can be derived
    from the floating potential.  This particular data set includes spacecraft
    event time, floating potential, spacecraft potential, and electron number
    density.  Data are presented in ASCII text tables of fixed-length records
    for ease in data handling.
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    This data set comprises spacecraft event time, floating potential,
    spacecraft potential, and electron number density that were derived from
    RPWS measurements.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of software
    programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw telemetry
    packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were compressed by
    one of a number of compression algorithms by the RPWS flight software
    onboard, apply conversion lookup tables or algorithms to convert telemetry
    data numbers into physical units, and make any corrections required.  See
    chapters 5-11 of the RPWSCAL document in the DOCUMENT directory for
    details on how the data included in this data set were calibrated.  These
    data are calibrated using the best calibration tables and algorithms
    available at the time the data were archived.  Should a significant
    improvement in calibration become available, an erratum will be noted in
    the erratum section.  Later versions of  the products may contain better
    calibrations.  The floating potential (Ufloat) is directly measured by
    the Langmuir Probe.  The spacecraft potential Usc is derived from the
    floating potential Ufloat using the formula:
 
	Usc = Ufloat / (1-(5/6)*exp(ds/D))
 
    where ds is LP distance from spacecraft, 150cm, D is the Debye length in
    centimeters calculated from D = 6.9 * sqrt(Te*11600/Ne), Ne is proxy
    electron density in cm**-3, and we assume Te, magnetospheric electron
    temperature to be 100eV.
 
    The proxy electron density is determined by an empirical relation found
    between Ufloat and the electron density measured by the CAPS electron
    spectrometer as described in MOROOKAETAL2009.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The archived data are the results of applying the above derivation of the
    spacecraft potential and of the proxy electron density based on the RPWS
    LP measurement of the floating potential, presented as ASCII tables as a
    function of spacecraft event time.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility&apos;s SPICE kernels
    describing the position and attitude of Cassini and various solar system
    bodies as a function of time are archived separately.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The data in this data set are floating and spacecraft potentials and a
    proxy for the electron density measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe.  The
    floating potential is corrected with spacecraft attitudes so that it
    represents the value in the LP sunlit condition.  If desired, the SPICE
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the spacecraft
    frame to virtually any frame which  may be of use in analyzing these
    data.  However, for most purposes, the parameters may be considered point
    measurements at Cassini  (they are at most 0.5s long) and may be entirely
    adequate with no coordinate transformations at all.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    These data are supplied to the Planetary Data System as an online
    collection of files in a PDS volume directory structure or as a standard
    compressed archive, such as ZIP or TAR.GZ, of this collection.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set contains floating and spacecraft potentials and a proxy for
    the electron density acquired by the Cassini RPWS instrument for the
    interval described below.  Every effort has been made to ensure that all
    data returned to JPL from the spacecraft are included and that the
    calibration is accurate.  Electron densities will not be available for
    number densities above 5 cm**-3.  The accuracy of the electron densities
    depends on the scatter in the Ufloat-to-density relation and in the
    accuracy of the CAPS electron densities, themselves.  The absolute
    accuracy of the electron density is likely 50% (factor of 2) but the
    relative density from time-to-time is likely reliable.  See
    MOROOKAETAL2009 for a discussion of the electron density accuracy.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The RPWS Langmuir proxy electron density data will be reviewed internally
    by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will
    also be peer reviewed by the PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our knowledge
    and attempts to determine completeness.  In general, the RPWS/LPR
    instrument was operated continuously most of the time from SOI and
    forward, and gave higher resolution data during each moon flyby.  Data
    gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply to downlink gaps,
    some of which were imposed by limitations on DSN station availability.
 
    The floating potential measurements are made with variable cadence
    through the entire mission at Saturn.  This data set presently includes
    data through day 234 of 2010.  Later measurements will be added at a later
    date.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps have interference in
    individual sweep samples.  These samples have been filtered away before
    analysis and should not pose a problem for the delivered output
    parameters.  The Ufloat proxy method for this data set is applicable only
    for densities below 5 cm**-3.  To avoid uncertainty of the transition
    region, data are limited to radial distance beyond 7 Rs from Saturn and
    absolute magnetic latitude above 15 degrees.  Also the data inside 10 Rt
    from Titan are not included for the same reason.  The proxy method uses
    the photoelectron condition directly measured by the instrument and
    therefore not available when LP is totally in shadow.
