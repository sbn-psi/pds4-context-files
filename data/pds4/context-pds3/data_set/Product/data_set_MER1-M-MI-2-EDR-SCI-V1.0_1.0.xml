  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains data to help understand the fine-scale
    morphology, reflectance, and texture of rock surfaces and soil as
    well as the accumulation of dust on the capture and filter
    magnets. Several types of imaging data products can be created
    onboard the rover. Image data volume can be reduced by summing rows
    or columns, subframing (or windowing), or downsampling. Because the
    goal of MI observations is to resolve small features on Mars, row or
    column summing is not likely to be performed on MI images. However,
    subframing (selecting a part of the image for downlink) and/or
    downsampling (calculating a mean or median of pixels in specified
    blocks) can be used to reduce MI data volume for downlink. Subframe
    products are defined by starting row and column and by number of
    rows and columns. Downsampling can be used to create a thumbnail
    version of an image for rapid downlink and assessment on the ground.
    If the thumbnail indicates that the image is of scientific interest,
    the full-resolution image can be later returned to Earth. A
    histogram of the image data can also be generated and returned to
    Earth as a separate product. Reference pixels are returned as a
    separate product if requested.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    This data set uses the Committee on Data Management and
    Computation (CODMAC) data level numbering system. The MER Camera
    Payload EDRs are considered Level 2 or Edited Data
    (equivalent to NASA Level 0). The EDRs are reconstructed from
    Level 1 or Raw Data, which are the telemetry packets within the
    project specific Standard Formatted Data Unit (SFDU) record. They
    are assembled into complete images, but are not radiometrically or
    geometrically corrected.
 
    Microscopic Imager EDR data products were generated by the
    Multi-mission Image Processing Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    using the telemetry processing software mertelemproc. The EDRs
    produced are raw uncalibrated data reconstructed from telemetry
    packet SFDUs and formatted according to the Camera EDR/RDR Software
    Interface Specification. Meta-data acquired from the telemetry
    data headers and a meta-data database were used to populate the PDS
    label. There will not be multiple versions of a MER Camera Payload
    EDR. Missing packets will be identified and reported for
    retransmission to the ground as partial datasets. Prior to
    retransmission, the missing EDR data will be filled with zeros. The
    EDR data will be reprocessed only after all partial datasets are
    retransmitted and received on the ground. In these cases, the
    original EDR version will be overwritten. The EDR data product will
    be placed into FEI for distribution.
 
  Data
  ====
    As the fundamental science image data archive product, the Science
    EDR will be generated by the Athena Pancam Science and Microscopic
    Imager Science Teams under SOAS at JPL to recover the original
    12-bit raw measurement obtained by the respective science camera to
    within the uncertainty of the noise in the original measured value.
    The size of a Science EDR data product is approximately 2 MB. The
    total estimated volume of Science EDRs over the course of the
    nominal 90-day MER mission is less than that of the Operations
    EDRs, and depends on the definition of the Science EDR archive set.
 
    The data packaged in the camera data files will be decoded,
    decompressed camera image data in single frame form as an Experiment
    Data Record (EDR). The Full Frame form of a standard image data file
    has the maximum dimensions of 1024 lines by 1024 samples.
 
    1) Full Frame EDR
       Full Frame EDRs are stored as 16-bit signed integers. If 12-to-8
       bit scaling is performed, then pixels are stored in 16-bit format
       and only the last 8 bits of teh 16-bit integer are used.
 
    2) Thumbnail EDR
       Thumbnail EDRs are stored as 16-bit signed integers or 8-bit
       unsigned integers. If 12-to-8 bit scaling is performed, then
       pixels are stored in 16-bit format and only the last 8 bits of
       the 16- bit integer are used. The Thumbnail EDR is a sized down
       version of the original acquired image (i.e., camera returned
       pixel data), and size of the binary EDR image data is variable.
       However, the original acquired image is not always downlinked.
       The main purpose of a Thumbnail EDR is to provide an image
       summary using a very low data volume compared to the original
       image.
 
    3) Sub-frame EDR
       Sub-frame EDRs are a subset of rows and columns of the
       1024 x 1024 full frame image. Sub-frame EDRs are stored as 16-bit
       signed integers. If 12-to-8 bit scaling is performed, then pixels
       are stored in 16-bit format and only the last 8 bits of the
       16-bit integer are used.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    MER Camera Payload downlink processing software is focused on rapid
    reduction, calibration, and visualization of images in order to make
    discoveries, to accurately and expeditiously characterize the
    geologic environment around the rover, and to provide timely input
    for operational decisions concerning rover navigation and Instrument
    Deployment Device (IDD) target selection. Key software tools have
    been developed at Cornell University, at JPL by the MIPL, SSV, and
    APSS groups, at NASA Ames, and at the USGS/Flagstaff. These tools
    can also be used to process MI images (see below), as well as Navcam
    and Hazcam images, which have substantial scientific potential in
    addition to their operational importance
 
    PDS-labeled images and tables can be viewed with the program
    NASAView, developed by the PDS and available for a variety of
    computer platforms from the PDS web site
    http://pdsproto.jpl.nasa.gov/Distribution/license.html.
    There is no charge for NASAView.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    The data set will initally be delivered and kept online. Upon
    Mission completion, the Microscopic Imager EDRs will be delivered
    to PDS on DVD as part of the complete MER EDR data set.
