  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains version 2.0 of raw calibration images acquired
    by the High Resolution Visible CCD (HRIV) from 04 October 2007 through
    28 November 2010 during the EPOCh, 103P/Hartley 2 Encounter, and cruise
    phases of the EPOXI mission.  This dataset supersedes version 1.0 which
    contained raw calibration only through February 2010.
 
    The purpose of these data are to monitor the HRIV CCD and improve its
    calibration as needed.  EPOXI calibration activities generally followed
    those designed for the Deep Impact mission.  For example standard
    calibration targets continue to include the Moon, 16 Cyg A, Achernar,
    Beta Hyi, Canopus, HD 60753, HD 79447, NGC 3114, NGC 7027, Vega, sky
    frames, stim lamp frames, and dark frames.  Additionally HD 80607 was
    imaged in early November 2007 as a preliminary photometry check for
    EPOCh exoplanet transit observations.   The Deep Impact calibration
    pipeline was the foundation for EPOXI until improvements were
    implemented for the Hartley 2 encounter as described in the Hartley 2
    calibration summary report located in the DOCUMENT directory.  For a
    detailed discussion of how the instruments were calibrated for EPOXI see
    Klaasen, et al. (2011, in preparation) [KLAASENETAL2011].  The Deep
    Impact instrument calibration is described by Klaasen, et al. (2008)
    [KLAASENETAL2006] and Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].
 
    A list of the calibration activities relevant to this dataset is
    provided below and a description of each activity follows.  The EPOXI
    in-flight calibrations summary chart in the DOCUMENT directory provides
    a quick-look at the activities.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      Instrument Checkout:  On 4 October 2007, the three science instruments
        were turned on for the first time in more than two years.  Sky
        frames acquired by the HRIV  CCD confirmed the mechanical components
        such as the shutter and filter wheel were functioning.  The
        instrument exhibited nominal behavior of background levels.
 
      EPOCh Photometry Test:  On 4-9 November 2007, EPOCh photometry tests
        were performed.  During these tests, the HRIV instrument observed a
        bright (V=9) visual binary star (HD 80607) for 12 continuous hours
        to check pointing and photometric stability.  The observations were
        taken using the 256-by-256 sub-array mode of the HRIV CCD.  The
        spacecraft successfully captured the star images and held them on
        the sub-array for the full duration of the test.  However the images
        were unexpectedly offset by 59 microradian (12.2 arcsec).  This was
        due to stellar aberration, which was not included for stellar
        observations during the Deep Impact mission.  After correcting for
        aberration, the spacecraft pointing was within specifications.
 
      HRIV Scattered Light Calibration:  On 17 December 2007, a
        calibration for scattered light using Earth&apos;s moon was performed for
        the HRIV instrument using long and short exposures.  Many of these
        images were obtained with the moon outside but near the field of
        view of the HRIV CCD to allow analysis of the amount of light that
        is scattered into the field of view from bright objects just outside
        or within the field of view.
 
      Lunar Calibration:  On 29 December 2007 as the spacecraft approached
        Earth, the three science instruments used the Moon as a target to
        acquire data for recalibration purposes.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  On 9 January 2008, the first of the
        standard cruise calibrations for the three science instruments was
        performed.  The calibration sequence included observations of
        several standard stars, both solar analogs and hot stars with few
        absorption lines in their spectra for absolute calibration of all
        instruments, a stellar cluster for checking geometric distortion in
        the cameras, and a planetary nebula for checking the wavelength
        calibration of the spectrometer.  This sequence was designed such
        that it could be rerun, with few if any changes, after completion of
        the EPOCh observations and then again just before and just after the
        observing program for comet 103P/Hartley 2.
 
      EPOCh Darks/Stims for Transit Obs:  Observations of EPOCh transiting
        extrasolar planets were bracketed by sets of dark and internal
        stimulator lamp frames to aid photometric analysis.  These frames,
        acquired from 22 January through 31 August 2008, are sub-frame
        images (256x256 or 128x128 pixels) with exposure times of 50 or 100
        milliseconds.  Unique exposure IDs were assigned for these
        EPOCh-specific calibrations:  9600000 and 9600001 for the darks and
        9600002 and 9600003 for the stim lamp frames.
 
      EPOCh Darks for Earth Obs:  At the end of each Earth observation
        period, a set of HRIV dark frames was acquired for calibration
        purposes and is included in this dataset.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  A second standard cruise calibration
        was performed on 23-25 June 2008 for the HRIV and HRII instruments.
        The sequence was very similar to that used for the calibration
        performed on 9 January 2008, except the MRI instrument was turned
        off because of thermal and telecommunication concerns.
 
      HRIV PSF Calibration:  On 17 December 2008, additional data were
        acquired for improving point spread functions (PSF) for the HRIV
        CCD. Analysis of early EPOXI calibration data and EPOCh stellar
        observations indicated the PSFs had changed since mid-2005 when the
        functions were last generated for Deep Impact.
 
      EPOCh Earth North Pole Darks:  On 27-28 March 2009, EPOCh acquired a
        full set of observations (24 hours) of Earth at high northern
        latitudes using the HRIV CCD and the IR spectrometer.  At the end of
        this campaign, HRIV darks were acquired for calibration purposes and
        included in this dataset.
 
      Checkout after HRI Turnoff &amp; HRIV Mechanical Checkout:  Before
        repeating the Earth South Pole observation of 27-28 September 2009
        that was prematurely aborted when HRI turned off, a standard imaging
        checkout of the HRII, HRIV, and MRI instruments was performed after
        HRI was powered up on 30 September 2009.  HRIV took images of the
        sky.  A mechanical checkout of HRIV was performed on 01 October:
        a miniature HRIV Earth observing sequence of darks that cycled
        through the filters 21 times was run to check for 5-V telemetry
        channel noise.  The results of the tests were satisfactory.
 
      EPOCh Earth South Pole #2 Darks:  On 04-05 October 2009, EPOCh
        acquired a full set of observations (24 hours) of Earth at high
        southern latitudes using the HRIV CCD and the IR spectrometer.  At
        the end of this campaign, HRIV darks were acquired for calibration
        purposes and included in this dataset.
 
      EPOCh Microlensing Obs:  On 05-08 October 2009, HRIV spent four days
        imaging the known exoplanet microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-266,
        where the foreground lensing star and its exoplanet bend light of
        the source star.  EPOCh reused the sequence from the HRIV exoplanet
        transit observations in 2008 to obtain these data.  At the end of
        this observing period, a set of HRIV dark and internal stimulator
        lamp frames was acquired to aid analysis.  These EPOCh-specific
        calibrations are sub-frame images (256x256 or 128x128 pixels) with
        exposure times of 50 or 100 milliseconds and are assigned unique
        exposure IDs:  9600000 and 9600001 for the darks; 9600002 and
        9600003 for the stim lamp frames.
 
      EPOCh Mars Darks:  On 20-21 November 2009, EPOCh observed Mars for
        24 hours with the HRIV CCD and the IR spectrometer.  At the end of
        this campaign, HRIV darks were acquired for calibration purposes
        and included in this dataset.
 
      Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full, standard cruise calibration
        for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was completed on 16 February 2010.  The
        sequence was very similar to that used for the standard cruise
        calibrations in June 2008.
 
      HRIV PSF Calibration:  On 03 September 2010, the HRIV CCD imaged
        Canopus to monitor the point spread functions (PSF) for that
        instrument.  Analysis of HRIV calibration data since 2005 and
        EPOCh stellar observations in 2008 indicate the PSFs can change
        over time.
 
      Pre-Encounter Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full, standard cruise
        calibration for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was performed on 28-29
        September 2010.  The sequence was very similar to that used
        earlier in 2010.
 
      Darks for E-18 Hours to E+2 Days:  The imaging sequence that was
        executed from 03 to 06 November 2010 for the flyby of Hartley 2
        included HRIV dark frames for background and stripe removal
        analyses.
 
      Post-Encounter Standard Cruise Calibration:  A full post-encounter
        standard cruise calibration for HRII, HRIV, and MRI was performed
        on 27-28 November 2010.  The sequence was nearly identical to the
        pre-encounter calibration performed in September.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and the
    image quality map are described in the EPOXI SIS document.  The SDC
    did not apply any type of correction or decompression algorithm to the
    raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw HRIV image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte of eight bit flags to indicate the quality of
      each pixel in the primary image.  The data label provides a short
      description of each bit.  For more information about the FITS primary
      image and its extension or for examples of how to access and use the
      quality flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a PDS data label.  Many values in a label were extracted from
      FITS image header keywords which are defined in the document
      EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and EPOXI
      documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V3.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      HVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;HV&apos; identifies the HRIV
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 32
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 1000000, the
      first FITS file name would be HV07122918_1000000_001.FIT and the last
      would be HV07122918_1000000_032.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      For some HRIV calibration frames the raw data numbers were
      compressed on board the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table
      then downlinked, processed, and archived in the same format.  A
      compressed image is identified by the value &apos;COMPRESSED&apos; in the
      COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE keyword in the data labels or the COMPRESS
      keyword in the FITS headers.  See the EPOXI SIS and EPOXI Hartley 2
      Calibration Pipeline Summary documents as well as Klaasen, et al.
      (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006] for more information.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of HRIV to the Medium Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (MRI) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the instrument alignment section of the EPOXI SIS
      document or Klaasen, et al. (2011) [KLAASENETAL2011].
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
 
    Data Units
    ----------
      Raw image data are in units of raw data numbers.
 
 
    Target Name and Description
    ---------------------------
      The TARGET_NAME keyword in the data labels is set to the intended
      target, &apos;CALIBRATION&apos;, for each observation in this dataset. The
      TARGET_DESC keyword provides the name of the specific calibration
      target, such as &apos;DARK&apos; or &apos;VEGA&apos;.
 
 
    Imaging Modes
    -------------
      A summary of the imaging modes is provided here.  For more
      information see the EPOXI SIS and EPOXI Hartley 2 Calibration
      Pipeline Summary documents, Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005]
      and Klaasen, et al. (2011) [KLAASENETAL2011].

          2  SF1       512    512    Sub-frame, shuttered
          3  SF2S      256    256    Sub-frame, shuttered
          4  SF2NS     256    256    Sub-frame, not shuttered

      All modes are unbinned.  Most image modes have a set of bias
      overclock rows and columns, located around the edges of the image
      array.  All overclock pixels were excluded from the calculation of
      the values for MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in
      the data labels.  These overclock areas described in the Deep
      Impact instruments document and the Deep Impact instrument
      calibration document.

      A summary of the MRI filters is provided here.  For more information
      see the EPOXI SIS and EPOXI Hartley 2 Calibration Pipeline Summary
      documents, Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005] and Klaasen, et

        9  ORANGE       650    100
 
 
    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  NAIF used these kernels to produce the
    EPOXI SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The FITS files in this dataset were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project and were used extensively by the science teams to improve
    the calibration of instrument.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset, Version 2.0, was peer reviewed and certified for
    scientific use on 15 August 2011.  It supersedes Version 1.0
    which contained data only from October 2007 through February 2010.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset.  All calibration
    observations received on the ground were processed and included in this
    dataset.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this dataset
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However the
      latest SCLK (science version 84) applied to the Hartley 2 encounter
      data is good to within 0.01 seconds for converting the spacecraft
      timestamps to ephemeris time for observations acquired around
      closest approach.  Please note that the SCLK (version 65) used to
      compute UTC values and geometry for calibration data acquired from
      January 2009 through July 2010 has known discontinuities of up to a
      second.  Those discontinuities have been corrected in the latest
      SCLK, science version 84, applied to Hartley data.
 
      The mission operations team has figured out how to correct raw clock
      correlation data for the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft to allow
      timing fits that are accurate to well under the sub-second level as
      evidenced by the 0.01-second accuracy around the time the Hartley 2
      encounter.  The EPOXI project plans to use this method to generate a
      complete and highly accurate set of UTC correlations for the flyby
      spacecraft since the launch, resulting in a future version of a SCLK
      kernel that will retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep
      Impact and EPOXI data.  When this kernel is available, it will be
      added to the SPICE datasets for the two missions and posted on the
      NAIF/SPICE web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.  The EPOXI
      project will provide more precise times for archived data as time
      and funding permit.
 
 
    HRI Telescope Focus
    -------------------
      Images of stars acquired early during the Deep Impact mission in
      2005 indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  In-flight
      bakeouts during late February and early March 2005 reduced the
      defocus from about 1.0 cm to about 0.6 cm, resulting in a decrease
      in the width of stars from about 12 pixels to 9 pixels.  For more
      details, please see the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by
      Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006] and the Deep Impact image
      restoration paper by Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the HRIV CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are 1/6 of a pixel
      smaller vertically than a normal row.  Therefore, reconstructed
      images, which have uniform row spacing, have a 1/3-pixel extension
      introduced at the center of the array.  Thus for two features on
      either side of the midpoint line, the vertical component of the
      actual angular separation between those features is one-third of a
      pixel less than their measured difference in vertical pixels in the
      image.  As for all geometric distortions, correction of this
      distortion will require resampling of the image and an attendant
      loss in spatial resolution.  The standard pipeline process does
      not perform this correction so as to preserve the best spatial
      resolution.
 
      The two 1/6-pixel narrower central rows collect only 5/6 of the
      charge of a normal row.  This effect is corrected by the flat-field
      division for calibrated science images so that the pixels in these
      rows have the correct scene radiance assigned to them.  However,
      point-source or disk-integrated photometric measurements using
      aperture photometry areas that include these central rows will be
      slightly distorted unless special adjustments are made.  For
      example, the aperture photometry process for comet 9P/Tempel 1 added
      an extra 1/6-pixel worth of signal to the to the pixels in each of
      these two rows in the reconstructed, calibrated images as described
      in Appendix A of Belton, et al., (2011) [BELTONETAL2011].
 
 
    Out-of-Frame Target
    -------------------
      Some lunar calibration frames in this dataset do not contain the
      moon because of deviations in pointing.  However the intended target
      is specified by the TARGET_DESC keyword in the data labels.
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
