  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This shape model of asteroid 25143 Itokawa is based on 775 Hayabusa AMICA
    images taken from Sept. 11 through Nov. 12, 2005.  The shape model was
    derived by Robert Gaskell and is described in Gaskell et al. 2006.  Four
    levels of resolution are included.
    Additional information about the model and the images from which it is
    derived may be found in Gaskell et al. 2006b and Gaskell 2005.  The
    version of the model included here was prepared on August 29, 2007.
 
    The model was constructed from 871 L-maps, three dimensional
    representations of portions of the surface whose centers are control
    points.  Each L-map represents about 10,000 surface points.  The
    coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian body-fixed frame defined
    with the z-axis passing through the rotation pole and the x-axis passing
    through zero longitude which is defined by the &apos;black rock&apos; (lat 3.357 deg
    S, lon 0), a named feature on the surface.  The model is referred to the
    following pole:
 
    BODY2025143_POLE_RA = ( 90.02564 0 0 )
    BODY2025143_POLE_DEC = (-67.02704 0 0 )
    BODY2025143_PM = ( 129.73000 712.14376110 0 )
 
    Some parameters relating to this model:
    Number of control points:  871 (each tied to 99x99=9801 surface vectors)
    Number of measurements:  90720 (104 per control point)
    Number of images:  775
 
    Formal 1 sigma uncertainties from the solution:
    Control point location uncertainty:  35 cm
    Spacecraft position uncertainty:  2 m
    Camera pointing uncertainty:  .15 mrad
    (The control point location uncertainty refers to the vector with 3
    degrees of
    freedom.  The uncertainty for each vector component separately is 20 cm.)
 
    The models were originally prepared in the Implicitly Connected
    Quadrilateral (ICQ) format, and files in four levels of resolution are
    provided in the directory &apos;data/quad&apos;.  The filenames are of the form
    quadxxxq.tab, where xxx is the value of Q (an indicator of the
    resolution).  See below for the full definition of Q and the ICQ format.
 
    The models are also provided in a vertex-facet format, in directory
    &apos;data/vertex&apos;.  The four data files in this subdirectory are derived from
    the ICQ format files in the &apos;data/quad&apos; directory.  The filenames have the
    form verxxxq.tab, where xxx is the value of Q for the original ICQ model.
    In this way it is clear which vertex-facet model comes from which ICQ
    model.
 
    The file &apos;imagelist.tab&apos; is a list of the Hayabusa AMICA images used to
    generate this model.  It is provided in the &apos;data&apos; directory.
 
    A text file, &apos;icqmodel.asc&apos; is provided in the &apos;document&apos; directory which
    describes the ICQ format and the derivation of the vertex-facet versions.
    Some of the information in that file is reproduced below.
 
    ICQ Format Description
    ===============
 
    The global topography models (GTM) are presented here in an implicitly
    connected quadrilateral (ICQ) format.  The vertices are labeled as though
    they were grid points on the faces of a cube
 
                      0 --------- I --------- Q
                   0  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   J  .  .  .  . F.  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
                   Q  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 
    so that each of the six faces (F) contains (Q+1)^2 vertices v(I,J,F)
    (I=0,Q; J=0,Q) and Q^2 facets f(I,J,F) (I=0,Q-1; J=0,Q-1).  The facet
    f(I,J,F) implicitly has the vertices v(I,J,F), v(I,J+1,F), v(I+1,J+1,F),
    v(I+1,J,F).
 
    If the cube is unfolded, the six faces are arranged as
 
                                         -----------
                                         |         |
                                         |    1    |
                                         |         |
           -----------------------------------------
           |         |         |         |         |
           |    5    |    4    |    3    |    2    |
           |         |         |         |         |
           -----------------------------------------
                                         |         |
                                         |    6    |
                                         |         |
                                         -----------
 
    At each of the 12 edges of the cube, faces share common vertices so that,
    for example, the last row of face 1 has the same vertices as the first row
    of face 2.  The common edge vertices are, with I=(0,Q),
 
              v(I,Q,6)=v(Q-I,Q,4)
              v(I,0,6)=v(I,Q,2)
              v(I,0,5)=v(Q,Q-I,1)
              v(I,0,4)=v(Q-i,0,1)
              v(I,0,3)=v(0,I,1)
              v(I,0,2)=v(I,Q,1)
              v(q,I,6)=v(I,Q,5)
              v(q,I,5)=v(0,I,4)
              v(q,I,4)=v(0,I,3)
              v(q,I,3)=v(0,I,2)
              v(0,I,6)=v(Q-I,Q,3)
              v(0,I,5)=v(Q,I,2)
 
    and the eight corners share vertices from three faces:
 
              v(0,0,1) = v(0,0,3) = v(Q,0,4)
              v(0,Q,1) = v(0,0,2) = v(Q,0,3)
              v(Q,0,1) = v(0,0,4) = v(Q,0,5)
              v(Q,Q,1) = v(0,0,5) = v(Q,0,2)
              v(0,0,6) = v(0,Q,2) = v(Q,Q,3)
              v(0,Q,6) = v(0,Q,3) = v(Q,Q,4)
              v(Q,0,6) = v(0,Q,5) = v(Q,Q,2)
              v(Q,Q,6) = v(0,Q,4) = v(Q,Q,5)
 
    Thus of the 6(Q+1)^2 labeled vertices, only 6Q^2+2 are independent.
 
    The file structure is quite simple.  The first line contains the value of
    Q, and is followed by 6(Q+1)^2 lines containing the vertices.  A piece of
    Fortran code for reading the file would look like:
 
              READ(10,*) Q
              DO F=1,6
              DO J=0,Q
              DO I=0,Q
                READ(10,*) (V(K,I,J,F), K=1,3)
              ENDDO
              ENDDO
              ENDDO
 
    Here the vertices are represented by three-vectors.  In some cases extra
    components are added representing albedo, color, surface gravity, or other
    surface characteristics.  Since the labeling scheme implicitly contains
    the connectivity, no facet table is necessary.
 
    The quadrilateral facets in the model are not necessarily flat, since
    there is no guarantee that the four vertices are coplanar.  The facet
    normals are defined by the cross product of their diagonals.  This
    approximation presents no real difficulty because the spacings of the
    vertices are very small compared to the size of the body.  The standard
    form (Q=512) has 1.57 million vertices.
 
    Although it is not necessary, it is convenient to take Q to be a power of
    2.  Because of this choice, it is easy to &apos;dumb down&apos; a model by
    increasing the spacing by factors of 2.  Vertices of the form v(2I,2J,F)
    are retained and the others discarded.  Because of the quadrilateral facet
    structure, the models can also be &apos;densified&apos; through bilinear
    interpolation.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The RMS formal uncertainty in control point location had a vector
    magnitude of 35 cm, about 20 cm per degree of freedom (dof).  The RMS post
    fit residual of the control point solution was 15 cm/dof.  90720
    observations of 775 images and 871 control points went into the solution,
    including control point locations in the images, on the lit limbs and
    relative to one another due to L-map overlaps.  Although the model is
    sufficiently detailed to do so, no attempt was made to provide an accurate
    representation of the underside of the large Yoshinodai boulder.
 
    Note that he vertex-facet versions of the model have some duplicate
    vertices on the edges and corners of the cube.  The duplicate vertices are
    not used in the facet table, resulting in the presence of some vertices in
    the vertex table which do not appear in the facet table.  This does not
    affect the correctness of the vertex-facet version.
