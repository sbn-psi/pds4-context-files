  Data Set Overview
  =================
    Description of nephelometer files in the data bank:
 
    This file describes the data obtained by the Galileo Probe
    Nephelometer during the descent into the Jupiter atmosphere on
    December 7, 1995.  The total time of data acquisition was less
    than two hours before the destruction of the probe in the Jupiter
    atmosphere.
 
    The Nephelometer measured light scattering at 900 nm wavelength
    at five angles in order to determine properties of aerosol
    particles and clouds encountered during descent.

    The data are in tabular form in ASCII format, and thus can be
    read easily by FORTRAN (or similar) programs.  There are 21
    files.  Each starts out with a header in ASCII which describes
    the content of the columns and which a FORTRAN program should
    skip over before reading the data.

    File 1 description
 
    File 1 contains all of the Nephelometer data transmitted back
    during the encounter, in hexadecimal form.  They were taken
    directly from the file NEP0701A.SDM, sent from the project office
    in July 1996.
 
    Column 1 has the line number.  Each nephelometer frame is
    identified by a block of 20 lines beginning with the sync word EB
    90 followed by the nephelometer frame number in hexadecimal
    format.  Since a nephelometer frame is composed of data from 20
    consecutive spacecraft frames, frame number zero contains data
    from lines 1 through 20, and the frame number for later data is
    obtained by the integer division of ( line number - 1 ) by 20.
 
    Useful data ended at line number 878, and two lines of zeros have
    been added to complete nephelometer frame 43.
 
    As an aid to understanding hexadecimal format, the following
    examples are shown:
 
              Hexadecimal frame numbers  9,  A,  F, 10, 1A, and 20
              have the decimal equivalent 9, 10, 15, 16, 26, and 32.
 
    Column 3 contains the number 5 for A string data and 6 for B
    string data.  The file NEP0701A.SDM contains both, and where they
    overlap, the data is identical, except for a few lines where it
    is obvious which choice should be made.  This data set contains
    only A string data, because it is a complete set and where B
    string data exists there is no reason for preferring it over the
    A string data.
 
    Column 2 shows in decimal notation the probe minor frame number
    transmitted by the probe, cycling from 0 through 63.
 
    The minor frame number, and the date and time of transmission,
    are not essential to interpreting the nephelometer data, since
    the timing of the measurements is asynchronous with the time of
    transmission.  The first minor frame with nephelometer data is
    minor frame number 1.
 
    Columns 5 through 10 are the Universal Time and date assigned to
    each minor frame.  Columns 5 and 6 represent December 7, 1995.
    Columns 7 and 8 give the minute and hour, in that order, so that
    for example the numbers 7, 16 represent 2207 U.T.  Columns 9 and
    10 give the seconds and milliseconds.  The first digit of column
    10 generally increases by 1 for each line because the minor
    frames were transmitted at intervals of very nearly 4 seconds.
    After every 15 lines, column 7 is expected to increase by one,
    representing an addition of one minute.
 
    The remaining columns (11 through 15) contain the nephelometer
    data.
 
    Every twenty lines contains one nephelometer frame, the start of
    which is identified by a code word EB 90.  The next two digits
    comprise the nephelometer frame number, supplied by the
    nephelometer clock, beginning with frame 0 at startup and ending
    at frame 43 (hexadecimal notation 2B).  Since the data set is
    complete, the frame numbers are found where the index is 1, 21,
    41, etc., with the frame number equaling (index - 1)/20.
 
    The first several words comprise the engineering data for the
    frame and they are followed by the words for the nephelometer
    measurements.
 
    In the hexadecimal printout, a frame contains 100 words of 8 bit
    length.  To unpack the data, we have strung the words together to
    recover the original group of 800 binary bits, and then extracted
    the 10 bit nephelometer words along with the 8 and 2 bit
    housekeeping data.  Rollover corrections had to be applied to
    some of the housekeeping data when the analog signals
    representing temperature, etc., exceeded the expected range of
    the analog to digital converter.  The unpacked data, in counts,
    are shown in Files 3 through 8.
 
    File 2 relates the time of each measurement to the atmospheric
    pressure and temperature and the probe altitude as determined by
    the ASI experiment.  Thus the data in the remaining files are
    labelled by atmospheric pressure in order to relate nephelometer
    findings to the atmospheric environment.
 
    Files 9 through 21 are cross sections computed according to the
    parameters described in the headings.  (See reference 3)

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    Because the instrument deteriorated in the hot internal probe
    environment near the end of descent, valid data may have been
    obtained only for the first 35 to 40 min of descent,
    corresponding to an ambient pressure of ~10 to 13 bars.
