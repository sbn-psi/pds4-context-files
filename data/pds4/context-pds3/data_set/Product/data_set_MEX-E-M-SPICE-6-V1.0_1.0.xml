            SPICE deals with ancillary data needed to support the planning
            for, and analysis of, science instrument data. As well as
            software (the SPICE toolkit) and documentation, SPICE provides
            data files, called kernels, that contain ancillary information
            which has been created in such a way as to allow easy access and
            correct usage by the space science and engineering communities.

1. SPICE System Overview
   =====================
 
   SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary information
   needed to recover the full value of science instrument data. In
   particular, SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary
   ephemerides, instrument mounting alignments and spacecraft
   orientation. Data needed for relevant time conversions is also
   included.
 
 
   SPICE was designed by the Navigation and Ancillary Information
   Facility (NAIF) to aid scientists and engineers with ancillary
   and engineering data. This data comes from a wide range of
   sources such as the spacecraft, the mission control center and
   the designers of the spacecraft and its instruments.
 
 
   The ancillary data comprises information on data acquisition;
   position and orientation of the spacecraft at the time of
   acquisition; information on the target, such as location, shape
   and orientation; reference frame specifications and time
   conversion data.
 
 
   The primary SPICE data sets are often called &apos;kernels&apos; or &apos;kernel
   files&apos;.  These kernels are composed of ancillary information,
   which has been created in such a way as to allow easy access and
   correct usage by the space science and engineering communities.
 
 
   In addition to the kernels, there is software provided, known as
   the SPICE toolkit, along with standards, documentation and
   software support. The SPICE toolkit and documentation can be
   found on:
 
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/
 
 
   The SPICE toolkit was freely offered to the worldwide space
   science and space mission engineering communities at the time
   this data set was released. The few rules governing its use are
   posted on the &apos;Rules&apos; page of the NAIF website:
 
      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/rules.html
 
 
   SPICE is used on a number of space missions, such as ESA&apos;s Mars
   Express, SMART-1, Venus Express and Rosetta missions; NASA&apos;s Mars
   Global Surveyor, Stardust, Cassini, Mars Exploration Rovers, Mars
   Reconnaissance Orbiter and Deep Impact. The SPICE system has been
   produced and is maintained by Caltech&apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
   under contract to the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration.

3. The Mars Express SPICE dataset
   ==============================
 
   The Mars Express SPICE dataset consists of several SPICE kernels,
   organised as follows:
 
   *  CK kernels. This kernels contain information about
      orientation of the space vehicle or any articulating
      structure on it. More information on the CK kernels in this
      dataset is provided in CKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  FK kernels. Reference frame specifications. Definitions of,
      and specifications of, relationships between reference frames
      (coordinate systems). Among the frames kernels included,
      there are kernels that specify reference frames related to
      the earth and the spacecraft. More information on the FK
      kernels in this dataset is provided in FKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  IK kernels. Kernels that hold intrument information, such as
      field of view or internal timing. There is a different kernel
      for ASPERA, HRSC, PFS and OMEGA. More information on the IK
      kernels in this dataset is provided in IKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  LSK kernel. This kernels hold a table with the leapseconds
      used to convert between ET and UTC. If there are multiple
      LSK kernels in this dataset, the latest kernel supersedes the
      previous ones. More information on the LSK kernel(s) in this
      dataset is provided in LSKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  PCK kernels. These kernels provide information about Solar
      System bodies orientation and shape, and possibly parameters
      for gravitational, atmospheric or rings models. The dataset
      contains PCK kernels for the planets, their satellites, and
      the asteroids Lutetia and Steins. More information on the PCK
      kernels in this dataset is provided in PCKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  SCLK kernel. This kernel (spacecraft clock coefficients)
      allows for conversion between ET and spacecraft clock. If
      there are multiple LSK kernels in this dataset, the latest
      kernel supersedes the previous ones. More information on the
      SCLK kernel(s) in this dataset is provided in SCLKINFO.TXT.
 
   *  SPK kernels. Kernels with information about ephemeris
      (position and velocity) of the spacecraft and solar
      system bodies. The dataset provides such information for
      the planets, the Sun, the Moon, the New  Norcia tracking
      station, several DSN tracking stations, and the spacecraft.
      More information on the SPK kernels in this dataset is
      provided in SPKINFO.TXT.
 
 
   3.1 - Origin of the kernels.
 
      a) Generic kernels provided by NAIF.
 
           - Binary and text PCK and LSK kernels.
 
           - Some SPK kernels with ephemeris of the solar system
             bodies.
 
           - SPK kernels for ground stations.
 
           - Frames kernels for ground stations.
 
      b) Other kernels provided by NAIF.
 
           - The instrument kernels (IK) have been developed NAIF,
             the intrument teams and RSSD/ESA.
 
           - The Mars Express frames kernel has been created by NAIF,
             in collaboration with RSSD/ESA.
 
      c) Kernels generated with ESOC Ancillary Data.
 
           - ESOC ancillary data are the main source of information
             required to create SPICE kernels for attitude (CK),
             orbit (SPK) and time (SCLK) information for the
             Spacecraft.
 
           - Also, ESOC ephemeris data are used in the creation of
             SPK kernels for martian satellites. See next chapter
             (3.2) for a more detailed explanation on how these
             kernels are generated.
 
      d) Kernels created by the Mars Express SGS (Science Ground
         Segment), alone or in collaboration with the intruments
         teams. These include:
 
           - CK kernels with orientation of the Mars Express Solar
             Arrays.
 
           - RSSD frames kernel.
 
           - ESTRACK_V01.BSP and ESTRACK_V01.LBL. These kernels
             contain respectively position and frame information
             for the ESA ESTRACK network ground stations. The user
             must be aware that the data in these kernels are
             low accuracy.
 
 
      e) Kernels from other sources. These include:
 
           - Ephemeris kernels provided by Royal Observatory of
             Belgium. They contain spacecraft position information,
             calculated independently of ESOC ancillary data.
 
           - CK kernels describing the motion of the ASPERA scanner,
             produced by the ASPERA team.
 
 
   3.2 - Creation of SPK, CK and SCLK kernels from ESOC Ancillary
         Data.
 
      Orbit Data.
      ----------
 
         In terms of orbital data, the mission can be divided in
         three different phases: cruise phase, nominal phase and
         extended phase. This dataset provides all the available
         orbit data at the moment the dataset was compiled.
 
         Several different types of data products are provided by
         ESOC: ORHM and ORMM.
 
         The ORHM product covers the cruise phase from launch to the
         Mars Insertion, and provides the orbit data as heliocentric
         states. There is only one ORHM product. During the nominal
         and extended phases, new ORMM files are provided on a regular
         basis, each of them covering a month period. The orbital
         data contained in these files are states with respect to
         Mars.
 
         MARSAT_ESA products are created using ESOC ephemeris, and
         give ephemeris information for the martian satellites, from
         2004 until the end of 2007. Creating MARSAT_ESA kernels for
         further dates is not foreseen.
 
      Attitude Data.
      -------------
 
         Attitude data for the spacecraft are provided for all mission
         phases except for safe modes, for the past and the near
         future. The attitude is provided in several records, called
         segments, each covering a specific time span. These segments
         have no overlap, but there may be gaps between the segments,
         and even gaps in the segments. The available attitude data
         is usually predicted, although kernels with reconstructed
         data are present in the dataset if needed (for time
         intervals for which the predicted attitude is known to
         be not accurate enough).
 
      Time Correlation Data.
      ---------------------
 
         Time Correlation is one of the most critical pieces of
         information needed for the use of the SPICE system within
         the Mars Express mission. This information allows the
         conversion between the Mars Express S/C Clock time and UTC
         time.
 
 
      ESOC always provide predicted and reconstituted orbit data,
      but only predicted attitude data. Only SPK kernels with
      reconstructed data are archived.
 
 
      ESOC delivers time correlation data which are the source for
      the SCLK kernel.
 
 
      An automated system, called ADCS (Automatic Data Conversion
      System) is responsible for the generation of CK, SPK and SCLK
      kernels from the ESOC flight dynamics data. ADCS detects when
      a new product was generated or a new time correlation packet
      was available, and run a series of processes in order to
      create the proper kernels.
 
 
      ADCS uses the SPICE toolkit in order to fulfill its task. It
      runs in a server physically located at ESAC.
 
 
   3.3 - Using the SPICE kernels.
 
      At least a basic knowledge of the SPICE system is needed in
      order to use this kernels. The SPICE toolkit provides versions
      in Fortran (SPICELIB), C (CSPICE), IDL (icy) and MATLAB
      (mice), and the user can choose any one that suits him/her.
 
 
      The SPICELIB routine FURNSH, CSPICE function furnsh_c, and icy
      routine cspice_furnsh load a kernel file into the kernel pool
      as shown below.
 
 
      CALL FURNSH ( &apos;kernel_name&apos; )
      furnsh_c    ( &apos;kernel_name&apos; );
      cspice_furnsh, &apos;kernel_name&apos;
 
 
      In the case when two or more files contain data overlapping in
      time for a given object, for binary kernels, the file loaded
      last takes precedence.
 
 
      If two (or more) text kernels assign value(s) using the &apos;=&apos;
      operator to identical keywords, the data value(s) associated
      with the last loaded occurrence of the keyword are used -all
      earlier values have been replaced with the last loaded
      value(s).
 
 
      Loading Kernel Files into a SPICE-based Application
      ===================================================
 
      A metakernel file, called &apos;MEX_Vvv.TM&apos;, can be found under the
      /EXTRAS/MK directory in this dataset. This file can be used
      with a SPICE-based application running on a UNIX workstation to
      load Mars Express SPICE data provided in this data set together
      (note that the logical path provided in the PATH_VALUES keyword
      and pointing to the volume root directory should be changed to
      the actual path of the volume root directory on the system where
      the volume is mounted).
 
      When there are two or more kernels that cover the same time
      interval (as is the case here for the .BSP and .BC kernels)
      the last kernel loaded is the one used by the SPICE software
      for computations in the interval or overlap.
        </data_set_desc>
        <confidence_level_note>
       The SPICE kernels in this dataset are either
       provided by NAIF (for instance, kernels containing
       parameters describing the planets, or the LSK kernel
       containing information about leapseconds) or calculated
       from the orbit and attitude data information generated
       by ESOC. In both cases the archive team are confident that
       the SPICE data is correct and accurate within the precision
       provided by the software and the instruments at the time
       the data was archived
        </confidence_level_note>
