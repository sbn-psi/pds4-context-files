  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe
    Sweep data set includes all thermal plasma information derived from
    Langmuir Probe voltage sweeps acquired in the inner magnetosphere
    and during Titan, Enceladus, and other icy satellite encounters for
    the entire Cassini mission.  This data set includes spacecraft event
    time, radial distance from either Saturn or the target moon,
    electron number density, electron temperature, and spacecraft
    potential.  Data are presented in ASCII text tables of fixed-length
    records for ease in data handling.  A browse data set of PNG images
    is included, providing a graphical summary of the data for each
    inner magnetosphere pass or moon encounter.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    This data set comprises spacecraft event time, radial distance from
    either Saturn or the target moon, electron number density, electron
    temperature, and spacecraft potential that were derived from RPWS
    measurements.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw
    telemetry packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were
    compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the RPWS
    flight software onboard, apply conversion lookup tables or
    algorithms to convert telemetry data numbers into physical units,
    and make any corrections required for antenna capacitive loading or
    other effects.  See chapters 5 - 11 of the RPWSCAL document in the
    DOCUMENT directory for details on how the data included in this data
    set were calibrated.  These data are calibrated using the best
    calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data
    were archived.  Should a significant improvement in calibration
    become available, an erratum will be noted in the erratum section.
    Later versions of the products may contain better calibrations.  The
    sweep data itself consist of 0.5s long current-voltage
    characteristics (usually every 24s during Titan flybys) and in the
    voltage range +/-4V (for flybys above 1200km altitude, +/-32V has
    been used).  The voltage sweeps are swept from both negative and
    positive voltage bias (i.e., two sweeps occur per 0.5s) to check
    for  hysteresis artifacts. Very few were found, and corrected for.
    The analysis of the current-voltage characteristics has been made
    with Orbit Motion Limited (OML) theory using a non-linear least
    square fitting routine. The ions and photoelectrons part (negative
    bias) was first removed (linear fit), before fits were made for the
    electron part (positive bias). Up to three electron components were
    found, but only the dominant population results were kept for
    archiving.  Sheath-Limited (SL) fits were made to confirm the
    validity of the  output parameter results. SL features are detected
    in the sweeps near closest approach of Titan (dense plasma).
 
 
  Data
  ====
    The archived data are the results of the OML analysis for each
    calibrated sweep of the Langmuir probe receiver (LPR) of the RPWS,
    presented as ASCII tables as a function of spacecraft event time.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility&apos;s SPICE kernels
    describing the position and attitude of Cassini and various solar
    system bodies as a function of time are archived separately.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The data in this data set are thermal plasma parameters derived from
    current-voltage relationships measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe.
    These parameters are presented as detected by the sensor and are not
    rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the
    spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in
    analyzing these data.  However, for most purposes, the parameters
    may be considered point measurements at Cassini (they are at most
    0.5s long) and may be entirely adequate with no coordinate
    transformations at all.
 
 
  Media/Format
  ============
    These data are supplied to the Planetary Data System as an online
    collection of files in a PDS volume directory structure or as a
    standard compressed archive, such as ZIP or TAR.GZ, of this
    collection.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    This data set contains thermal plasma parameters derived from
    Langmuir probe voltage sweeps acquired by the Cassini RPWS
    instrument for the interval described below. Every effort has been
    made to ensure that all data returned to JPL from the spacecraft is
    included and that the calibration is accurate.  Thermal electron
    output data will usually not be available, due to photoelectron
    current contamination, for number densities below  1 cm**-3 and/or
    for temperatures above 10eV, i.e. outside the ionosphere of Titan.
    Data &lt; 1 cm**-3 and/or &gt; 10 eV should be regarded as uncertain.
    Electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be regarded as uncertain,
    as the rms electric field surface variability of the spherical TiN
    coated probes is 0.015eV, and the number of sweep samples used for
    the temperature estimation becomes small (4-5 samples out of 1024
    samples over +/-4V). The sampled probe current amplitude determines
    the confidence of the  output parameters. For electron densities
    &gt;100 cm**-3 the confidence level is better than 10% for the electron
    density and spacecraft  potential, while it is better than 20% for
    the electron temperature.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The RPWS Langmuir probe sweep output data will be reviewed
    internally by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS. The
    data set will also be peer reviewed by the PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness. In general, the
    RPWS/LPR instrument was operated continuously most of the time from
    SOI and forward, and gave higher resolution data during each moon
    flyby.  Data gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply
    to  downlink gaps, some of which were imposed by limitations on DSN
    station availability.
 
    The following Titan flybys have NO valid RPWS/Langmuir probe sweep
    data:
    T07 - no data
    T24 - no data
    T37 - no data
    T53 - nothing to see
    T60 - no data
    T66 - nothing to see
    T67 - nothing to see
    T72 - nothing to see
    T73 - no data
    T74 - nothing to see
    T76 - no data (data gaps)
    T79-T81 - nothing to see
    Data from T101 and forward are TBD.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps have interference in
    individual sweep samples.  These samples have been filtered away
    before analysis and should not pose a problem for the delivered
    output parameters. The RPWS HFR receiver produces interference
    signals in the LPR in certain negative bias voltage ranges. These do
    not affect the analysis on the electron  (positive bias voltage
    side), and cause otherwise no significant error in the derived ion
    parameters.
 
    Thermal electron output data will usually not be available, due to
    photoelectron current contamination, for number densities below 1
    cm**-3 and/or for temperatures above 10eV, i.e. outside the
    ionosphere of Titan. Data &lt; 1 cm**-3 and/or &gt; 10 eV should be
    regarded as uncertain.  Electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be
    regarded as uncertain, as the rms electric field surface variability
    of the spherical TiN coated probes is 0.015eV, and the number of
    sweep samples used for the temperature estimation becomes small (4-5
    samples out of 1024 samples over +/-4V).
