            Volume containing data from &apos;Cruise 5&apos; and more
            specifically: &apos;Active Payload Checkout 12&apos; (PC12) -
            23-04-2010 and 4-05-2010

            Payload Checkout 12 (PC12) was an active checkout where a target
            independent opportunity to perform interactive operations and to
            request spacecraft pointing was given to all Rosetta payload
            teams. All Rosetta payload took part in this scenario The Active
            Payload Checkout 12 ran for 23 consecutive days starting on the
            23th April 2010 until the 14th May 2010.During PC12 GIADA
            performs only a passive test (GD01) similar to the previous
            Passive Payload Checkouts. This passive test (GD01), which
            includes standard procedures and full functional verification,
            was executed by switching on Main and Redundant I/Fs in sequence
            and executing similar procedures for the two cases. The data
            reported in this data set have been converted from ADC counts to
            engineering values. The quality of the Housekeeping and
            Calibration data is good. Scientific data are due to noise, as no
            grain event is expected during this mission phase. These data
            must be only considered to evaluate GIADA behaviour and not as
            real scientific data. Data reported by GDS and IS are due to
            noise as no dust event is expected during this mission phase. MBS
            frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs. temperature
            dependence, if present, are due to deposition of contaminants
            existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping and Calibration
            data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to evaluate instrument
            health and behaviour when compared with similar data acquired
            during other mission phases.

        The format of data reported in GIADA data sets is the same
        for all mission phases. Data reported by GDS and IS are due
        to noise as no dust event is expected in this mission phase.
        MBS frequency changes, once normalised for frequency vs.
        temperature dependence, if present, are due to deposition of
        contaminants existing in the S/C environment. Housekeeping
        and Calibration data from all GIADA sub-systems are useful to
        evaluate instrument health and behaviour when compared with
        similar data acquired during other mission phases.
