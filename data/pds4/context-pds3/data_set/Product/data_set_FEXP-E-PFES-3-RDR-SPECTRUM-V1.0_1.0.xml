            The PFES Archive contains calibrated reduced data record (RDR)
            spectra acquired by the Portable Field Emission Spectrometer
            (PFES) during the earth-based 1989 Geologic Remote Sensing Field

            Portable Field Emission Spectrometer (PFES) data were acquired on
            July 15 and 17, 1989. A total of 31 measurements were collected
            for GRSFE. Of these measurements, 13 were calibrations and 18
            were of representative surfaces. The data were collected
            primarily to support the calibration of the TIMS data and to
            assist in interpreting spectral mixing in the mid-infrared. Sites
            were selected for calibration that covered a range of
            emissivities. On July 15, PFES data were collected at Kelso Dunes
            and the Cima Volcanic Field as part of the Calibration Team
            effort. Daedalus and SIRIS data were collected over the same
            sites. For the PFES data, the Kelso Dunes Bright Target site
            represented the silica-rich endmember and the Cima basalt tephra
            Dark Target site represented the more silica-poor endmember. On
            July 17, PFES data were collected at two of the modelling sites
            at Lunar Lake (the playa and the cobble sites). Several spectra
            were also collected at the playa surface next to the Lunar Lake
            thermistor site.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      Portable Field Emission Spectrometer (PFES) data were acquired
      on July 15 and 17, 1989.  A total of 31 measurements were
      collected for GRSFE.  Of these measurements, 13 were
      calibrations and 18 were of representative surfaces.  The data
      were collected primarily to support the calibration of the TIMS
      data and to assist in interpreting spectral mixing in the
      mid-infrared.  Sites were selected for calibration that covered
      a range of emissivities.  On July 15, PFES data were collected
      at Kelso Dunes and the Cima Volcanic Field as part of the
      Calibration Team effort.  Daedalus and SIRIS data were
      collected over the same sites.  For the PFES data, the Kelso
      Dunes Bright Target site represented the silica-rich endmember
      and the Cima basalt tephra Dark Target site represented the
      more silica-poor endmember.  On July 17, PFES data were
      collected at two of the modelling sites at Lunar Lake (the
      playa and the cobble sites).  Several spectra were also
      collected at the playa surface next to the Lunar Lake
      thermistor site.
 
      PFES data files in this release of the GRSFE archive consist of
      tables of wavelength, emissivity, measured radiance, gain of
      internal Blackbody calibration source (not used), Blackbody
      radiance fit to data, and measured radiances of external cold
      and hot Blackbodies.  Note that emissivities have not been
      corrected for atmospheric effects.  However, data acquired over
      the aluminum target (called CALIBRATION READING in PDS labels)
      are provided for users who want to do the corrections.
