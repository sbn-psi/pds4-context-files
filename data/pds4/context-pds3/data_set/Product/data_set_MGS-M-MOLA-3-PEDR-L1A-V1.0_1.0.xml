  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft included a laser altimeter
    instrument. The primary objective of the Mars Orbiter Laser
    Altimeter (MOLA) is to determine globally the topography of Mars
    at a level suitable for addressing problems in geology and
    geophysics.
 
    A Precision Experiment Data Record (PEDR) contains MOLA science
    mode telemetry data that has been converted to engineering and
    physical units. Each PEDR contains a 2 second span of data, called
    a frame, that is retrieved from the 14 second MOLA science mode
    telemetry packet. Therefore, seven PEDRs are generated from each
    MOLA science mode telemetry packet. In addition to the frame data,
    the packet&apos;s engineering and housekeeping data are retained and
    subcommutated among the seven PEDRs that comprise a packet.
    Additional packet information, e.g., packet header, are stored in
    the PEDR as well as data correction values which were used to
    process the telemetry data into the PEDR data. Storing the data
    correction values ensures that the telemetry data can be re-
    created from the PEDR data.
 
    Contained in a PEDR are the range value computed at the frame mid-
    point, the planetary radius at the frame mid-point, and the
    planetary radius for each shot. There are 20 possible shots in a
    2 second frame, numbered from 1-20. Additionally, ground and
    spacecraft location, i.e., latitude, longitude, and radial
    distance, obtained from the precision orbit data for the frame
    mid-point, is stored in the PEDR.  The change in latitude and
    longitude per frame is also stored, so that the location of
    individual shots may be obtained by interpolation via the generic
    formula: shot_location = mid_pt_location + (shot_no - 10.5)/20 *
    delta_location.
 
    The range and precision orbit data are given with respect to the
    Mars Global Surveyor center of mass. The planetary radius values
    are computed with respect to the center of mass of Mars. Ground
    locations are given in the IAU 1991 coordinate system prevailing
    at the time of Mars Observer. Additional information describing
    the instrument and its configuration are included in the PEDR.
 
    A complete listing of all parameters contained in a PEDR can be
    found in Table 1 of the PEDR Software Interface Specification
    (SIS) document [MOLAPEDRSIS1998]. A description of the parameters
    contained in a PEDR is found in Table 2. The engineering/house-
    keeping data are listed in Table 3; this table also describes the
    location of the engineering/ housekeeping data among the seven
    PEDRs that constitute a MOLA telemetry packet. Additionally, the
    PEDR format and contents are described in the PEDR Data Dictionary
    in Appendix B of the SIS.
 
    The topography of Mars relative to the gravitational potential was
    determined by the MOLA instrument during 18 assessment orbits over
    the northern hemisphere, i.e., near periapsis.  Overall more than
    221,000 valid laser ranges were collected.  While the instrument
    was designed to collect data in a mapping orbit of approximately
    400 km altitude, MOLA performed well out to its 785 km maximum
    range.  This science volume contains the complete archival
    delivery of MOLA data for the Assessment Subphase of the MGS
    Mission, SPO-1 and SPO-2.
 
    Users of MOLA data must be aware of two important differences
    between the MOLA coordinate system and the Viking-era
    coordinates. These differences are significant when comparing MOLA
    groundtracks to MDIMs, USGS DTMs, or maps. MOLA uses the
    areocentric coordinate frame (see below). MOLA areocentric
    latitudes should be converted to areographic latitudes using the
    equation provided below. (Note that Viking data was processed
    assuming different radii: equatorial radius = 3393.40 km and polar
    radius = 3375.73 km for a flattening of 1/192.) There appears to
    be a residual discrepancy in latitude of less than 0.1 degree
    (6 km) magnitude, and variable sign, between MGS and Viking
    coordinates. MOLA longitudes are also areocentric, with positive
    degrees East. However, there is an additional eastward offset of
    the Viking-era coordinate system relative to the present MGS
    inertial frame. The magnitude of this offset ranges from about 0.1
    to 0.3 degrees (&lt;20 km). More than one factor may contribute to
    this discrepancy; the primary reason is a change in the IAU
    coordinate system. Other possible effects are a drift of the prime
    meridian due to uncertainties in the martian rotation period or
    errors in the Viking spacecraft orbital position that propagated
    through the image processing [SMITHETAL1998]. Subtracting the
    Viking longitude West from 360.0 converts to longitude East.
    Subtracting 0.2 degrees from the Viking East longitude is a first-
    order correction for comparison to the MOLA data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
    One of the primary standard products are the Precision Experiment
    Data Record (PEDR) files.  The files are in binary format with an
    attached PDS label. The SIS document describing this standard
    product is included on this volume.
 
    The PEDRs contain instrument science data, sub-spacecraft
    location, estimates of the planetary radii, and radii of an areoid
    equipotential surface.  Areoid radii were calculated using the
    interim gravity model mgm0827e with a mean equatorial radius of
    3396 km. The MOLA topography is the shot planetary radius minus
    the areoid radius at a given location.
 
 
  Parameters
  ==========
    The MOLA instrument measures the round-trip time of flight of
    infrared laser pulses transmitted from the MGS spacecraft to the
    Martian surface.  The instrument normally operates in a single
    autonomous mode, in which it will produce ranging measurements.
    Surface topography estimates can be derived from these data, given
    appropriate corrections for the position and attitude of the
    spacecraft.
 
 
  Processing
  ==========
    The PEDRs incorporate the best multi-arc orbital solutions derived
    from the Goddard Mars potential model mgm0827e, and the available
    tracking. The latest (January 20, 1998 or later) spacecraft SCLK
    timing corrections have been applied.  The ranges account for
    instrument delays and the leading edge timing biases, estimated by
    the receiver model of [ABSHIRE&amp;SUN1998]. This model assumes a
    Gaussian shape for the transmitted and surface-scattered pulse
    waveforms, using the detector threshold settings and the observed
    pulse width and energy measurements between the threshold
    crossings to infer the true pulse centroid, width, and amplitude.
    The eccentric orbit brought MOLA much closer to the surface of
    Mars than the design called for, thus the pulse width and energy
    measurements were saturated for much of each pass.  Caution must
    be exercised when interpreting these measurements.  Laser energies
    are calculated according to the transmitter model of
    [AFZALETAL1997].  A post-launch calibration to the MOLA oscillator
    frequency has been applied, based on the difference between the
    spacecraft high-resolution timer and the MOLA clock, resulting in
    an estimated frequency of f=99,996,232 +/- 5 Hz.  This frequency
    is given in the PEDR and may change due to clock drift.  The
    interval between shots, as well as the shot time-of-flight, is
    controlled by this frequency. The shot interval in seconds,
    delta_t = 10,000,000 / f.
 
    Time tags are given in ET seconds of MOLA fire time.  Timing of
    the shots is interpolated to ~100 microseconds. This step is
    essential in the highly elliptical orbit insertion geometry
    because the spacecraft may change its radial distance by as much
    as 1600 meters per second.
 
    The spacecraft time, from which the shot time is derived, is
    subject to further timing corrections TBD.  &lt;Currently 113 ms for
    s/c, 1.113 s for attitude&gt;
 
    The ground location and planetary radius is calculated in inertial
    (J2000) coordinates as the difference between the spacecraft
    position vector and the MOLA one-way range vector. The direction
    of the MOLA vector is obtained from project-supplied spacecraft
    attitude kernels and the boresight calibration of the instrument
    with respect to the spacecraft. The one-way range of the laser
    shot to the planet is obtained from the two-way range by
    correcting for the change in spacecraft position during laser shot
    time-of-flight. The ground point position vector is transformed
    into planetary body-fixed coordinates at a time midway between the
    MOLA laser fire time and the shot receive time, using the IAU 1991
    planetary model.
 
    Due to the inverse-square-law energy return in the link equation
    [ZUBERETAL1992], the instrument detector was saturated during a
    part of the periapsis approach.  Received pulse energy and pulse
    width are resolved during the portion of the pass when the
    detector is not saturated.  The absolute accuracy of these
    quantities is about 5%.
 
    There is a table entry for each non-zero shot range detection for
    all in-range packets in the data stream.  Occasional corrupted
    range values occur due to transmission errors, and some packets
    are lost entirely. A packet sequence number is generated by MOLA.
    The sequence number was initialized to 0 just before the planet
    came within range during the SPO-1 and 2 data passes via a restart
    command, while during the Hiatus subphase the restart occurred
    earlier.
 
    Some MOLA ranges are either clouds or false detections due to the
    intrinsic noise characteristics of the receiver. The MOLA ranges
    that are true ground hits are flagged with a positive number in
    the tables.
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    N/A
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    The diverse processing and display requirements for various
    observational quantities necessitates flexibility in the choice of
    coordinate system.  Two systems are used to describe data products
    on this volume:
 
     1.  The areocentric coordinate system [DAVIESETAL1994B], more
    generally described as planetocentric, is body-centered, using the
    center-of-mass as the origin.  Areocentric latitude is defined by
    the angle between the equatorial plane and a vector extending from
    the origin of the coordinate system to the relevant point on the
    surface.  Latitude is measured from -90 degrees at the south pole
    to +90 degrees at the north pole.  Longitude extends from 0 to 360
    degrees, with values increasing eastward (i.e., it is a right-
    handed coordinate system) from the prime meridian
    [DAVIESETAL1994B].  This coordinate system is preferred for use in
    geophysical studies in which, for example, estimates of elevation
    or gravitational potential are generated mathematically.
 
     2.  The areographic system (more generally, the planetographic
    system) uses the same center-of-mass origin and coordinate axes as
    the areocentric coordinate system.  Areographic latitudes are
    defined by a vector normal to a reference ellipsoid surface.
    Longitudes are measured from the prime meridian and increase
    toward the west since Mars is a prograde rotator
    [DAVIESETAL1994B].  This system is standard for cartography of
    Mars and most existing maps portray locations of surface features
    in areographic coordinates. For MGS, the following data have been
    adopted as standard for defining the reference spheroid for
    computing the areographic latitudes [DAVIESETAL1994B]:
 
          Equatorial radius = 3397 km
          Polar radius      = 3375 km
          Flattening        = 0.0064763
 
    Note that the flattening is computed as one minus the ratio of the
    polar radius to the equatorial radius.  The relationship between
    areographic and areocentric latitudes is approximated as:
 
          tan(lc) = (1-f) * (1-f) * tan(lg)
 
    where:  f = flattening
           lg = areographic latitude
           lc = areocentric latitude

        <confidence_level_note>
 
  Overview
  ========
    The resolution of the data is about 40 cm vertically, and about
    330 m along-track, limited by the 10 Hz firing rate of the laser.
    The absolute, long-wavelength radial orbit error is estimated to
    be about 30 m. The uncertainty in absolute ground spot location is
    limited by the attitude knowledge of the spacecraft, and is
    estimated to be about 400 m at a nominal range of 400 km.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    The volume containing the MOLA PEDR topography dataset was
    reviewed by MGS mission scientists and by PDS.
 
 
  Data Coverage/Quality
  =====================
    On May 26, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft entered
    into Phase 2 of the Science Phasing Orbit (SPO-2). SPO is a near-
    polar (92.869 degrees) inclination orbit with a period of 11.6
    hours and a periapsis altitude of about 170 km. During SPO-2 MOLA
    will collect observations of Mars&apos; northern hemisphere, with
    emphasis on detailed mapping of the north polar ice cap. Late June
    and early July 1998 is expected to be the period of maximum ice
    loading for the northern cap for the current Martian year and thus
    represents an especially exciting and crucial time for MOLA
    observations. We anticipate that the observations collected during
    this period will contribute significantly towards understanding
    the present-day Martian volatile budget. We have just completed a
    two-week period where the MGS spacecraft was tilted on alternating
    orbits so that MOLA could fill in the 2 degree coverage gap at the
    north pole that occurred because the spacecraft orbital
    inclination is not exactly 90 degrees.
 
    MOLA collected 61 topographic profiles of Mars&apos; northern
    hemisphere during the first phase of the MGS Science Phasing Orbit
    (SPO-1) that spanned the period from March 26, 1998 until April
    28, 1998. All of the MOLA data collected during SPO-1 were
    presented in thirteen talks and posters during the week of May 26,
    1998 at the Spring Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in
    Boston.
 
    MOLA&apos;s SPO-1 observations were collected during orbital passes in
    which targeted imaging of surface features was not being
    attempted. Collection of images of target sites (Viking 1 &amp; 2 and
    Pathfinder landing sites and Cydonia) resulted in a loss of about
    25% of the data that MOLA could have been collected during that
    period.
 
    SPO-1 ended in mid-May, just before solar conjunction. During
    conjunction the sun is in the line of sight of the spacecraft,
    which interferes with communication, so commanding of the
    spacecraft is minimized.
 
    The Science Phasing Orbit represents a hiatus from aerobraking
    that is needed so that the spacecraft will achieve the desired
    local time for the mapping orbit that will be entered next spring.
    SPO will last until September 11, 1998, after which time MGS will
    resume aerobraking to circularize its current elliptical orbit.
    During aerobraking passes, the MOLA instrument does not collect
    data because the instrument is not pointed at the surface during
    the period of time when the spacecraft is within ranging distance.
 
    Previous MOLA data was collected during the capture orbit phase of
    the MGS mission shortly after orbit insertion on September 15,
    1997. A further 17 passes were collected between October 14 and
    November 6, 1997 during a hiatus in the aerobraking phase
    necessitated by a study of the integrity of a solar panel that was
    slightly damaged after launch.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    Our current understanding of the Martian environment, the
    capabilities of MGS, and its suite of instruments is changing
    rapidly.  MOLA has met or exceeded its design expectations. It has
    demonstrated a measurement precision of 30 centimeters over flat
    terrain. While designed for nadir-looking operation in a circular,
    365- to 445-km- high orbit, MOLA has ranged successfully to Mars
    at distances from 170 to 786 km, and to surface slopes up to 60
    degrees. MOLA has ranged to the surfaces of clouds lying at
    elevations of a few hundred meters above the surface, to over
    15 km high, and returned measurements of atmospheric opacity
    greater than 2 during dust storms. MOLA returned 628 ranges to the
    moon Phobos in an orbital fast-flyby. The planetary range
    detection rate in clear atmosphere has exceeded 99% over smooth
    and rough terrain.
 
    The MOLA ranges and precision orbit data are preliminary, and will
    be revised as our knowledge of the spacecraft and the Martian
    gravity field improves. Important details of the instrument design
    and the progress of the mission are found in the files INST.CAT
    and MISSION.CAT. The orbital, atmospheric and thermal environment
    of the Orbit Insertion phase has introduced uncertainties in the
    data quality. The eccentric orbits and frequent off-nadir pointing
    during ranging cause a greater sensitivity to errors in spacecraft
    timing and attitude knowledge than expected in mapping orbit.
 
    Orbital location is derived from radio observations and a host of
    dynamic variables, most important of which is the gravitational
    attraction of Mars. Improvements in the gravity field are best
    obtained from tracking at low elevations, now being obtained from
    MGS.  The gravity model used to calculate the orbits is an interim
    solution, internally designated mgm0827e, derived from Goddard
    Mars Model 1.  This model is given in the software directory as
    GMM1.2 for the purpose of defining an equipotential topographic
    reference surface.  GMM1.2 is necessarily constrained and lacks
    detailed resolution of the polar regions, so that unmodeled
    orbital perturbations accumulate. At the same time, the areoid
    reference surface may vary by tens of meters depending on the
    choice of gravity model. The altimetric error budget is currently
    dominated by orbital uncertainty, and does not yet meet our goal
    of 30 m accuracy.
 
    The spacecraft radial distance from Mars may change up to 1.6
    meters in a millisecond due to orbital eccentricity, and up to
    8 meters between the time the pulse is fired and it is received.
    Altimetric processing therefore depends strongly on timing
    accuracy and knowledge of the direction in which the laser is
    fired. MOLA data are time-tagged once per packet with a spacecraft
    time code, calibrated to ground time. An instrument clock
    synchronized to the Payload Data System provides 1/256 second
    resolution timing. The PEDRs contain interpolated laser transmit
    time to a precision of a tenth of a millisecond.
 
    Altimetric crossovers are being used to assess the accuracy of the
    data. It has been determined that the observations have a
    systematic timing bias, further, that the attitude knowledge of
    the spacecraft is offset.  The range observations have been
    registered with orbital position by assuming that the time tag of
    the MOLA range, as derived from the spacecraft clock, is 113
    milliseconds earlier than the actual transmit time. In addition it
    is assumed that the time tag of the attitude kernel provided by
    the MGS Project is one second later than the time of the
    spacecraft attitude sensor readings, due to a software filter
    delay. The precise causes and amounts of offset are under
    investigation.
 
    Range measurements are affected by the counting frequency
    standard, electronic delays, and spreading of the returned pulse
    due to ground slope and detector characteristics. The MOLA timing
    interval unit has a an accuracy of ~2.5 nanoseconds, its precision
    being extended from the 10 ns clock rate by two interpolator bits.
    However, &apos;range walk&apos; due to variable threshold settings, pulse
    amplitude and shape, can be many times greater than measurement
    precision, especially over rough terrain. The MOLA instrument
    records the pulse width and amplitude during the time that the
    signal exceeds a software-controlled threshold. Shot ranges are
    corrected in processing via a mathematical receiver model
    [ABSHIRE&amp;SUN1998], assuming linear instrument behavior. Flat and
    highly reflective terrain, short ranges, and abnormal atmospheric
    conditions can drive the electronics into saturation, increasing
    detected pulse width and invalidating the instrument model. The
    range corrections for saturated returns are limited to their
    equivalents for terrain with a slope of one in sixteen. Meter-
    level changes in topography must be interpreted in the context of
    the range correction values in the PEDR files.
 
    The returned-optical-pulse-width and energy measurements must also
    be interpreted with caution, in view of the above-mentioned
    effects. Moreover, the detectors were not calibrated for the
    unusually cold conditions experienced during Orbit Insertion.
    Energy values are slightly higher than measured by test equipment
    under optimal conditions. The unsaturated return energy and
    reflectivity measurements were only designed for 5% accuracy in
    any case.
 
    Lastly, the presence of highly reflective clouds, and a level of
    noise returns consistent with instrument tradeoffs, has
    necessitated an empirical classification of shots as to their
    origin. The first shot of every 140 is likely to be triggered by
    an internal test source, but may be a valid ground return, while
    0.5% of the shots result from detector noise exceeding the
    triggering threshold. The probable ground returns have been
    flagged based on a combination of measurements and a stochastic
    model of topographic variability. An unambiguous classification is
    often impossible, given clouds that often follow the surface, and
    the dramatic variability of Martian terrain. The classification
    should be used only as a guide.
