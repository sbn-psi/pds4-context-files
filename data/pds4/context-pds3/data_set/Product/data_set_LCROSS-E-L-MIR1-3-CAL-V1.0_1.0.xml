    Data Set Overview
    =================
 
    This data set contains calibrated imagery from
    mid-infrared camera #1 (MIR1) on the LCROSS spacecraft.
    MIR1 is a filtered camera sensitive from 6.0 to 10.0
    microns.
 
    The images in this dataset have targets named Moon,
    Earth, Centaur, Calibration (i.e., not targeted) and
    TestImage.  Test images include ramps and settling-time
    images that contain no science content.
 
    Each calibrated image file is a 160 x 120, 32-bit
    PC_REAL greyscale image.  The effective field-of-view
    [FOV] is 16.0 [H] x 11.0 [V] degrees.
 
    The time each image was captured is encoded in the
    image&apos;s filename as follows:
 
      LCROSS_MIR1_CAL_&lt;timestamp&gt;.IMG
 
    where &lt;timestamp&gt; = YYYYMMDDHHMMSSmmm
      and YYYY = the four digit year;
          MM = the two digit month,
          DD = the two digit day, and so on
          through hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
 
    The detached label for each spectra has the same
    filename as the spectra but with the &apos;LBL&apos; extension.
 
    Related Data Sets
    =================
 
    MIR1_RAW (described in MIR1_RAW_DS.CAT) contains the raw
    versions of the images contained in this dataset of
    calibrated images.  The MIR2_RAW and MIR2_CAL datasets
    contain images from the other mid-infrared camera.  MIR2
    had almost exactly the same field of view and was
    slightly more sensitive due to having no added filter.
    However, MIR2 experienced a shift of focus during launch
    and produced out-of-focus images.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
 
       Science
       -------
 
       Gain is either High Gain for best sensitivity with
       low scene temperatures (T &lt; +150 C) or Low Gain for
       best sensitivity with high scene temperatures (+150 C
       &lt; T &lt; +500 C). The majority of the mid-infrared
       images are taken at High Gain.
 
       Housekeeping
       ------------
 
       Instrument temperature at the data collection time is
       reported in the label file under:
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE and
       INSTRUMENT_TEMPERATURE_COUNT in degrees Centigrade
       and raw counts, respectively.  This is a single
       telemetry point most representative of the
       instrument chassis temperature.
 
    Processing
    ==========
 
    Each mid-infrared image was transmitted digitally from
    the camera to the spacecraft, split into 20 separate
    packets, compressed losslessly and downlinked in
    telemetry.  The LCROSS ground system extracted the
    packets from telemetry, combined them into images, and
    converted them to PNG format.  These files were further
    processed with the LCROSS Archive program to generate
    the PDS-format image (.IMG) and ASCII label (.lbl)
    files, timestamping each pair with the UTC time the
    data was received by the spacecraft.
 
    This data path from camera to PDS is lossless except for
    missing packets, which occurred occasionally because
    LCROSS transmitted all science telemetry in realtime.
    Missing packets resulted either in missing images or in
    images with horizontal bands of missing data.  Each
    mid-infrared image packet contained 160 x 6 pixel band
    corresponding to 1/20th of an image.  Missing images are
    not contained in the dataset at all.  Missing bands are
    filled with zeros and their presence in an image is
    indicated by a value of &apos;Y&apos; for the MISSING_PACKET_FLAG
    attribute in each label file.
 
    This dataset contains radiometrically calibrated images
    in which data numbers (DNs) were mapped to scene
    temperature in degrees Centigrade.  The mapping is
    described in the Instrument Response and Calibration
    Report in the CALIB directory of this archive.
 
    Data
    ====
 
    These files are stored as 32-bit PC_REAL image files.
    Each pixel&apos;s value is reported in degrees Centigrade.
    Each image file has a corresponding detached PDS label
    file sharing the same filename and an &apos;LBL&apos; filetype.
 
    The EXTRAS directory contains these images in FITS
    format as well.
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
 
    These images utilize the camera&apos;s coordinate system.  To
    convert the coordinates to the LCROSS Payload Common
    Camera Coordinate System, the images must be flipped
    along the X axis (horizontally flipped).  A description
    of mapping the images with respect to each other and the
    spacecraft coordinate system is contained within the
    LCROSS Instrument Response and Calibration Report.
 
    Software
    ========
 
    The GSEOS Version used to generate these images is GSEOS
    5.2.407 (Feb 25, 2008), Python 2.2.3 (#37, Nov 28, 2003,
    04:20:20), Project Version 6.1.064.
 
    The LCROSS.py Python script used with GSEOS is Version
    Jun 11, 2008.
 
    The LCROSS Report Generator used on GSEOS created
    CCSDS.dat files is version 114.
 
    The LCROSS MIR calibration pipeline (contained within
    the Make Archive program) used to generate the
    calibrated images is Version 5.
 
    The version of Satellite Toolkit used to prepare geometric
    information for the labels is 8.1.3.
 
    The LCROSS Make Archive program used to assemble the
    PDS-formatted submission is dated 03/14/2010.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
 
    The confidence level is unspecified.
 
    Review
    ======
 
    This LCROSS data set was reviewed internally by the
    LCROSS science team before delivery to PDS.  This data
    set has passed a PDS peer review.
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
 
    This dataset contains all images taken by LCROSS Mid
    Infrared Camera #1 (MIR1) during the mission, in
    calibrated form.  These images are in focus.  The focus
    of MIR2 shifted during launch, hence images from MIR1
    are of higher quality than images from MIR2.  Otherwise,
    both cameras performed as designed.  Note that the
    bandpass filter in MIR1&apos;s optics gave it less
    sensitivity overall than MIR2.
 
    Downlink oversubscription did result in missing mid
    infrared images and uneven coverage during some parts of
    this dataset.  The effect of this is most significant
    during the lunar swingby.  Imaging rates were adjusted
    during the centaur impact to produce even coverage, and
    the effect is very minor there.  All other data
    collection periods were unaffected.  Images affected by
    this contain 6 pixel high horizontal bands of all-zeros
    data representing each missing packet.  These images are
    flagged by MISSING_PACKET_FLAG = Y in the label.
 
    Both mid-infrared cameras perform a flat field
    correction every two minutes.  This is done by very
    briefly lowering a uniform-temperature flap into the
    optical path.  This flap is visible in some images.
    These images are not flagged.
 
    The average camera sensitivity drifts with time,
    particularly within the first 10 minutes of being
    powered, due to temperature transients inside the
    camera.  Images generated within 10 minutes of the
    camera being powered on are flagged by
    LCROSS:MIR_CAL_VALID = N in the label.  Images generated
    later have a value of &apos;Y&apos; for this attribute.
 
    The calibration was developed to be most accurate at the
    end of one hour of operations, corresponding to the
    situation when observing the centaur impact.  Data
    captured close to power on is still useful, but the
    accuracy of its calibration is less.  This effect is
    less pronounced for MIR1 and more pronounced for MIR2,
    but the transition from invalid to valid calibration was
    set at 10 minutes from power on for both cameras.
 
    Limitations
    ===========
 
    Saturated or bad pixels are not identified within this
    data set.  Images containing horizontal banding due to
    missing telemetry are not removed, although they are
    flagged.  Images impacted by the flat field correction
    mechanism are not flagged.
 
    The temperature calibration provided is only useful for
    data sets taken for a chassis temperature between +17 C
    and +21 C. Outside this range, the calibrations may not
    be viable.  Calibrations were not performed for other
    operating temperatures.
 
    The average camera sensitivity drifts with time, as
    indicated by the LCROSS:MIR_CAL_VALID attribute in the
    labels of calibrated mid-infrared images.
 
    Data Compression
    ===============
 
    The data was compressed losslessly for transmission from
    the LCROSS spacecraft to the ground.  The PDS-formatted
    images (.IMG) are not compressed.
