  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The DENIS program (Deep European Near-Infrared southern sky
    Survey) was a ground-based survey of the southern sky with the aim
    of providing an extensive I,J,Ks photometric catalog of point and
    extended sources.  It was carried out at the 1.0 meter ESO
    telescope at La Silla, Chile from late 1995 through the end of
    1999.  The limiting magnitudes of the three bands I, J, and Ks
    centered at 0.8, 1.25, and 2.15 microns are respectively 18.5,
    16.5, and 13.5 to a sensitivity of about 2 sigma.
 
    The DENIS point source catalog was searched for known asteroids
    numbered from 1 to 8000 on the basis of their predicted positions.
    The ephemerides were computed by numerical integration and
    Chebyshev Polynomial approximations of a 10-body problem
    (Bec-Borsenberger 1992).  The orbits of the planets were included
    for completeness and were taken from JPL DE403 (Standish 1995).
    As initial conditions, the osculating elements of the Lowell
    Observatory Asteroid Orbital Elements Database were used.
 
    This resulted in 2190 matches in the DENIS catalog with 1931
    different asteroids found.  The results were published in Baudrand
    (2001 and 2004), constituting the first and second releases of the
    asteroid results.  Both the first and second releases are included
    in this data set.
 
    The data for this data set were obtained at the Centre de Donnees
    astronomiques de Strassbourg.  The data tables obtained there were
    modified in the following ways only.  The tables were concatenated
    into a single table, the columns were rearranged, phase angle was
    truncated to three digits after the decimal point, and DENIS image
    number was converted from a real number with no digits after the
    decimal point to an integer.

    See Baudrand (2001 and 2004) for a discussion of the photometric
    reduction pipeline, the asteroid matching procedure, and the
    photometric results.  The derivation of the predicted V magnitude
