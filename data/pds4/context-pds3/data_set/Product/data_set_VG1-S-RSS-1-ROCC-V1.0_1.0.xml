    Data Set Overview
    =================
      This data set consists of raw data collected during the Saturn
      egress radio occultation of Voyager 1 on 13 November 1980 plus
      ancillary files that might be useful in analysis of those data.
      The raw data are sampled voltage outputs from receivers tuned to
      the Voyager carrier frequencies at both S-band and X-band during
      the occultation.  The data have been reduced to give profiles
      of temperature and pressure as a function of height in the
      atmosphere [LINDALETAL1985], to infer magnetic field
      orientations in the upper ionosphere [HINSON1984], and to
      determine the distribution of particles [MAROUFETAL1986] and
      particle properties [ZEBKERETAL1985] in the ring system.
 
      During the Saturn occultation, the Voyager 1 spacecraft
      provided a coherent, dual-frequency microwave radio signal
      source.  The signal frequency was derived from a precision,
      onboard Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The spacecraft
      high-gain antenna (HGA) beamed that signal through the
      atmosphere and rings of Saturn.  As the spacecraft moved on
      its trajectory, the radio signal probed the atmosphere and
      rings at different radial positions from the center of mass.
      An hour later the signals were received using a 64-meter
      antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) near Madrid
      (Spain).
 
      To keep the refracted radio beam aimed toward the DSN antenna
      during the atmospheric occultation, the spacecraft attitude
      was adjusted so that the high-gain antenna (HGA) was pointed
      at the virtual image of Earth on Saturn&apos;s limb.  This ensured
      that maximum signal strength would be available from the
      deepest probing.  After the ring occultation, the HGA was
      turned from its normal Earth-pointing direction toward the
      rings; a forward-scattering experiment was conducted before
      normal Earth-pointing operations resumed about 100 minutes
      later.

    Parameters
    ==========
      The output of each S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier
      signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth
      approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.
      The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater
      potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its
      bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per
      second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;
      but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they
      are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)
      of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in
      inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere,
      and amplitude calibration for ring observations can be
      obtained by referencing signals to the background radiothermal
      noise in the data stream.
 
      The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the
      Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).
      Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,
      Saturn, and other bodies of the solar system were determined
      jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic
      Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to
      large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA
      (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are
      included with this archive.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      No processing per se has been carried out on these data.
      However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples
      were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.
      The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and
      the digital data were extracted onto computer compatible tapes
      (CCTs) with each receiver channel on a separate set of tapes.
      Because the S-band data had been oversampled originally
      (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only one of every three
      samples was saved during the transfer of S-band data to CCTs.
      This process, known as &apos;decimation&apos;, meant that 300 seconds
      of data could be stored on an S-band CCT whereas only
      100 seconds of X-band data would fit.
 
      Because analog recording technology was required to save the
      high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts
      in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special
      attention to counter fields in data record headers.
 
      Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN
      complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the
      entire set of Saturn occultation activities, the two were run
      in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were
      collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to
      capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team
      members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering
      300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).  Each tape had  6000
      records of 5056 bytes (56 bytes of header information
      and 5000 8-bit samples of receiver output voltage).  Tapes
      were numbered sequentially as CCTs were generated from the
      high density video originals.  Tapes with Saturn data from
      Recorders A and B were numbered as follows:
 
               1980-11-13 UTC        Tape  Numbers   Recorder
             -----------------       -------------   --------
             03:35:00-04:35:00       VJ6185-VJ6280       A
             04:05:00-05:05:00       VJ6089-VJ6184       B
             04:45:00-05:40:00       VJ6001-VJ6088       A
             05:35:00-06:00:00       VJ6509-VJ6548       B
             05:55:00-06:50:00       VJ6381-VJ6468       A
             06:45:00-07:10:00       VJ6549-VJ6588       B
             07:05:00-07:30:00       VJ6469-VJ6508       A
 
      Test and calibration data after the Saturn encounter were
      collected on Recorder A and have numbers VJ6612 through VJ6651.
 
      The original tape numbering has been preserved in the current
      file names, which have the form VJnnnnCC.ODR.  On tapes where
      one or more records could not be read, the original has been
      separated into two or more files.  The character &apos;C&apos; indicates
      the ordering of these file fragments with &apos;A&apos; being first (and
      the default with no tape reading errors), &apos;B&apos; next, etc.
 
      Each Original Data Record (ODR) file is accompanied by a
      minimal PDS label briefly describing the contents and referring
      the user to detailed documentation on file format.  The label
      file has name  VJnnnnCC.LBL.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Geometry Data - The raw radio data were originally reduced by
      the Voyager Radio Science Team using ephemerides in Celestial
      Reference Set (CRS) format -- state vectors at regular
      intervals.  The Saturn CRS file has been converted to ASCII and
      is archived as file CRS010AA.CRS in the GEOMETRY directory.
 
      The current version of the NAIF SPK file for the Voyager Saturn
      encounter is also provided; it is in the NAIF &apos;transfer&apos; format
      and is archived under the name VG1_SAT.SPK in the GEOMETRY
      directory.
 
      HGA Pointing Data - High-Gain Antenna (HGA) pointing information
      was delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team as binary files
      on computer tape.  Seven original binary files and an equal
      number of ASCII translations are included in the GEOMETRY
      directory.  File VH014.DAT and its ASCII translation VH014T.TAB
      are assumed to be the best files for analysis, but only because
      of the apparently higher file number (records documenting the
      history of these files have been lost).
 
      POCA Data - The Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly (POCA)
      set the (tunable) local oscillator in the DSN receivers.  To
      recover Doppler shifts resulting from gravitational forces on
      the spacecraft or propagation through media with varying index
      of refraction, the receiver tuning must be known precisely.
      The VG1SPOC5.DAT file in the CALIB directory contains binary
      POCA data; file VG1SPOC6.TAB holds the same frequency data in
      an ASCII table format.  Files VG1POC1.DAT and VG1SPOC3.DAT are
      original files giving frequency of the Voyager 1 S-band carrier
      expected at DSS 63; VG1SPOC2.TAB and VG1SPOC4.TAB are the
      respective ASCII translations.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      Original files (CRS files and HGA pointing files) were defined
      using the  EME-1950 coordinates system.  NAIF files, accessed
      with NAIF Toolkit software, allow extractions of positions and
      velocities in many coordinate systems.  The basic radio data
      (ODR files) are independent of coordinate system.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      The following main programs are included in the archive.  All
      were written in FORTRAN 77; all have been tested and used on
      a Sun ULTRA-5 running Solaris 2.5.1.  The SOFTWARE directory
      includes source code for these programs (and their subroutines)
      and a Unix Makefile which can be used to generate binary
      executables.  For non-Sun/Solaris systems, the listings
      may serve as a starting point for versions which will run on
      the local machine.
 
      RDHDR: Reads and displays contents of individual ODR record
             headers.
 
      UNPK: Separates header and data components of records in
             an ODR file.
 
      CRS2ASC.F: Converts Univac binary CRS file to ASCII. Included
             only for historical purposes since the binary CRS file
             has not been included with this archive.
 
      CRS2LBL.F: Extracts information from ASCII CRS file useful in
             creating a PDS label.  Included only for historical
             purposes.
 
      PREP_11_6.F: Program reformats Saturn data for use with
             Stanford quick-look and other processing software.
             Converts 8-bit samples in 5056-byte records to 16-bit
             samples in 1024-byte records, optionally corrects for
             missing or extra samples (analog tape dropout
             artifacts), and creates header record.
 
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The archival data set is written on CD-WO media using GEAR
      software and a Yamaha writer.  The CD-WO volumes conform to
      ISO 9660 standards.

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      This is a good data set.  Known problems are minor.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel
      prior to its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).
      The peer review was conducted in accordance with PDS
      procedures.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      This data set covers the Voyager 1 Saturn egress occultations
      (atmosphere and rings), the ring scattering experiment,
      and a post-experiment mini-ASCAL (HGA calibration) sequence.
 
      Quality issues include (1) the occasional loss of digital
      samples resulting from use of analog recording technology
      (dropouts), (2) the loss of records on a few tapes from
      deterioration of the CCT, (3) less than 8-bit accuracy in
      the analog to digital conversion, and (4) spurs and other
      anomalous signals in addition to the carrier.  Items (1)
      and (2) have been discussed above; items (3) and (4) are
      simply limitations in working at the technological
      frontier.  Note that many tapes from Recorder B suffer from
      a &apos;stuck&apos; bit.  That is, rather than 8-bit sampling
      accuracy, there is only 3-bit accuracy because the fourth
      most significant bit was always ON.
 
      Buffering: There were several points where buffering of data
      (momentary storage) may be important to the user.  (1) Time
      tags in ODR data records were buffered.  The first sample
      in an ODR file was taken on an integer second, but the time
      tag is slightly (a few microseconds) earlier.  (2) The
      data samples themselves were buffered, by an amount between
      1 and 2 sample periods (less than 6 microseconds).
      (3) POCA frequencies were buffered, so that the frequency
      in the POCA file should be associated with the previous
      second.  (4) The frequency rate in the POCA was double
      buffered (offset by 2 seconds).  The POCA buffering varied
      among data acquisition systems; the amounts indicated by
      (3) and (4) are the extremes.  Users should conduct
      self-consistency checks to determine the correct POCA
      buffering correction.  The buffering determined by the
      Voyager Radio Science Team has not been recorded.
 
      Polarization: Right-circularly polarized (RCP) signals were
      transmitted from the spacecraft at both S-band and X-band.
      Both right- and left-circular polarizations (LCP) were
      captured at the ground station.  The LCP data were collected
      primarily to detect depolarized signal during the ring
      occultation and scattering phases of the observations.
      Neither transmitting nor receiving antenna was capable of
      providing purely circular polarization; the end-to-end
      cross-polarized signal was probably somewhere between 20 and
      30 dB below the same-polarized signal.  Post-experiment LCP
      signal levels (e.g., after 06:46:00) may be useful for
      determining the actual level of cross-polarization.  No
      Saturn-related cross-polarization was reported by the
      Voyager Radio Science Team.
 
 
    Limitations
    ===========
      None.
