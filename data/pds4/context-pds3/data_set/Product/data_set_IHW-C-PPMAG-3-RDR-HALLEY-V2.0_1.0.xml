      Data Set Overview
      =================
      This data set presents the photometric magnitude measurements
      of 1P/Halley submitted to the International Halley Watch (IHW)
      Photometry and Polarimetry Network (PPN).  Both broadband and
      narrowband magnitudes are included, with filter parameters
      for each measurement.  In this second version, the FITS tables
      have been converted to flat ASCII, the PDS labels rewritten,
      a table combing all the measurements into a single, chronological
      set has been added, and known errata have been corrected.
 
      Modification History
      ====================
      The first version of this data set contained 744 sets of
      individual observation files.  Each file contained the results
      from one observer during one night.  For each such file there
      was a PDS label file, a FITS table header file detached from
      the data, and the FITS table data segment.
 
      PDS personnel made the following chages to create version 2:
 
        o PDS labels were completely rewritten. All comments, history
          notes and significant keywords from the FITS headers were
          either included as PDS keywords or documented in the
          DESCRIPTION section for each file.  The FITS headers were
          then discarded.
 
        o Observing times in the observation tables, originally
          stated as day number and fraction, were converted to the
          ISO standard time format (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss).  Day
          fractions were always supplied with at least four
          significant digits (five in some unusual cases).  Note
          that, therefore, times are never more accurate than the
          nearest second, and typically are only accurate to
          +/- 5 seconds.
 
        o Errata were corrected, including:
 
           - Removal of three records in each of two files (pmag0389
             and pmag0417);
           - Deletion of several files described as &apos;accidentally
             included&apos; (pmag0615, pmag0664 and pmag0682).  It was
             noted that these files were missing required supporting
             information (observing aperture, for example).
 
        o The &apos;all.tab&apos; file was created by adding the observatory,
          telescope, observer and file name to the records in each
          individual table, and concatenating the results into a
          single file.  This file was then sorted on the UTC field
          at the beginning of each record.

      Overview
      ========
      In general, quality varies from file to file among the
      observations.  Observers were asked to provide error
      bars (or an upper limit indicator) for all magnitude
      estimates, but this was not done in all cases.
 
      Users should check the file DESCRIPTION in the individual
      observation files for notes regarding reduction or
      observing conditions.
 
      Also, note that the errata list for version 1 of this
      data set included the following:
 
        For a number of NARROW BAND measurements, the integration
        times are not given; in these instances the original
        submissions only reported &apos;average&apos; values.
