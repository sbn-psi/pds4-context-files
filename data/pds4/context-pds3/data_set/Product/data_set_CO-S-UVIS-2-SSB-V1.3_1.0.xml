      The UVIS Solar Stellar Brightness Dataset
      =========================================
          The UVIS instrument is part of the remote sensing payload of
       the Cassini orbiter spacecraft.  UVIS has two spectrographic
       channels that provide images and spectra covering the ranges
       from 56 to 118 nm and 110 to 190 nm.  A third optical path
       with a solar blind CsI photocathode is used for a high
       signal-to-noise ratio stellar occultation by rings and
       atmospheres.  A separate hydrogen deuterium absorption cell
       measures the relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen
       from their lyman-alpha emission.  These channels are
       referred to as EUV, FUV, HSP, and HDAC in this document.
       The UVIS science objectives include investigation of the
       chemistry, aerosols, clouds, and energy balance of the Titan
       and Saturn atmospheres; neutrals in the Saturn magnetosphere;
       the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio for Titan and Saturn; icy
       satellite surface properties; and the structure and
       evolution of Saturns rings.  The basic instrument design
       adapts proven design concepts using a grating spectrometer
       followed by a multi-element detector.  We chose to use
       imaging, pulse-counting microchannel plate detectors because
       of more than a decade of experience using this kind of
       detector equipped with a CODACON readout anode.  The CODACON
       (Coded Anode Array Converter) acts as a photon locator.  The
       photon counts are accumulated in an external memory to build a
       picture that is periodically read out for transfer to the
       spacecraft memory and eventually, transmission to the ground.
       The two dimensional format for the CODACON detectors allows
       simultaneous spectral and one-dimensional spatial coverage.
       The detector format is 1024 x 64 (spectral by spatial).
          The Cassini HDAC consists of a channel electron
       Multiplier photodetector equipped with 3 absorption cell
       filters:  a hydrogen cell, a deuterium cell and an oxygen
       cell.  The oxygen cell is not utilized in flight.  The
       hydrogen and deuterium cells function as adjustable
       absorption filters.  In each cell a hot tungsten filament
       disassociates the hydrogen and deuterium molecules into
       atoms, producing an atomic density determined by each of 16
       different filament temperatures.  These atoms resonantly
       absorb the hydrogen and deuterium Lyman-alpha lines passing
       through the cells.  Cycling the filaments on and off and
       comparing the differences in signal gives a direct
       measurement of the relative hydrogen and deuterium signals.
       Each cell has two filaments controlled by separate filament
       current regulators.  Only one filament at a time per cell is
       used during flight.  A Pulse Amplifier Discriminator detects
       photoelectrons from the CEM and sends pulses to the UVIS
       instrument logic.   UVIS contains a high speed photometer
       with an integration time as short as 2.0 ms to observe stars
       occulted by the rings of Saturn.  The photon counts collected
       from the photocathode are passed as a time ordered sequence to
       the instrument, then to spacecraft memory for transfer to the ground.
          The data in a UVIS observation are a copy of what was in the UVIS
       memory buffer. That is, the observation consists of unprocessed
       experiment data stored in binary format. An observation
       belongs to one of four different types of data product: a
       spectrum, a time series of spatial-spectral images, a time
       series of detector counts, or an image at one wavelength.
       Each observation has a unique identifier that associates it
       with a time range and with the configuration of the
       instrument during that time.  Each data product will contain
       one observation and will be completely defined by a PDS
       label.  The objects will be correct in the sense that they
       will conform to PDS formatting requirements and will be
       consistent with data archived by the UVIS team.  They will
       be complete in that they will represent all data taken by
       the UVIS instrument.  In addition, CODMAC level 3 data products
       will be derivable from the archived data and an associated set
       of calibration data.
          The UVIS instrument can generate time series from the HSP and
       the HDAC channels.  A time series consists of a sequence of
       photometer counts each taken during a fixed time interval.
       An observation consists of a time series taken during a
       particular instrument configuration.  The time series
       generated by the HDAC channel may have additional
       complexity.  If the instrument dwell time configuration
       parameter is equal to one, the HDAC is in photometer mode and
       its output is a time series of detector counts.  If the
       dwell time is greater than one, the time series can be mapped
       into a table of 32 columns, each column corresponding to an
       HDACfilament voltage level in the order: d1..d16, h1..h16
       where d1..d16 correspond to the 16 voltage levels of the d
       cell and h1..h16 the same for the h cell.  The time series
       can be mapped to the table by mapping contiguous subsequences
       into the successive columns of the table.  The length of the
       subsequence is determined by the dwell time parameter of the
       instrument configuration.  A data product (also referred to
       as an observation) consists of a set of data taken during a
       single instrument configuration.
          The UVIS time series data product will be archived as PDS time
       series objects.  All instrument configuration data for an
       observation will be contained in the associated PDS label.
          For a detailed description of the UVIS instrument see the file
       ROOT/DOCUMENT/UVIS.TXT on this archive volume.
 
      Parameters
      ==========
 
      The observation type for each observation is found in OBSERVATION_TYPE
      column of INDEX.TAB.  The specific purpose of each observation
      may be found in the object DESCRIPTION field contained in the label.
 
      Processing
      ==========
      The observation data products are generated by the Laboratory for
      Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado using
      the Data Archiving and Processing System (DAPS) software.  This
      software receives telemetry packet SFDUs from the Telemetry Data
      System, extracts science and engineering data, archives the data
      in a database management system and produces PDS data and label
      object files located on a CD-ROM or DVD physical storage medium.
 
      All time information is generated from the spacecraft clock using
      the Cassini SCLKSET files.  The DAPS system uses NAIF software and
      project generated SPICE Kernels to generate pointing information.  All
      of these values are contained in the PDS object label.
 
      Data
      ====
      The UVIS instrument can generate time series from the HSP and the HDAC
      channels.  A time series consists of a sequence of photometer counts
      each taken during a fixed time interval.  An observation consists of a
      time series taken during a particular instrument configuration.  The
      time series generated by the HDAC channel may have additional
      complexity.  If all the filament levels are 0 then the HDAC is in
      photometer mode and its output is a time series of detector counts.  If
      there is a non-zero filament level the detector is in modulation mode
      and the time series can be mapped into a table of 32 columns, each
      column corresponding to an HDAC filament voltage level in the order:
      d1...d16, h1...h16 where d1..d16 correspond to the 16 voltage levels
      of the d cell and h1..h16 the same for the h cell.  The time series
      can be mapped to the table by mapping contiguous subsequences into
      the successive columns of the table.  The length of the subsequence is
      determined by the dwell time parameter of the instrument configuration.
      A  data product consists of a set of data taken during a single
      instrument configuration.
 
      The UVIS solar and stellar brightness time history data product is
      archived as a PDS time series object.  All instrument configuration
       data for an observation is contained in the associated PDS label.
 
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      HSP and HDAC calibrations do not have a software implementation,
      however a description of HSP calibration is located in
      SOFTWARE/CALIB/HSP_CALIBRATION.TXT.
 
      Coordinate System
      =================
      In the UVIS data products, all time values that are represented as
      strings  are in UTC time.  All time values are derived from the
      spacecraft clock  using the SCLKSCET translation table supplied by
      the  Cassini project.  All pointing data are expressed in the J2000
      coordinate system.
 
      Software
      ========
      LASP provides software for reading PDS data products.  This software
      is  located in the ROOT/SOFTWARE/READERS directory.  The software
      requires Java 1.4 compatible class libraries and RSI/IDL version 6.
      Instructions for running the  routines are located in the file
      READERS_README.TXT, located in the same directory.
 
      These readers are provided as a convenience for users to access the
      data. Users may choose another approach if desired.  The readers
      enable users to load PDS objects into an RSI/IDL process where they
      are represented as 3  dimensional arrays of integers corresponding to
      the PDS Qube object in which they are stored.  PDS label data are
      stored in an IDL structure variable.
 
      DISC FORMAT
      =================================================================
      (e.g. IBM PC, Macintosh, Sun, VAX) may access the data.  Specifically,
      the disc is formatted according to the UDF-Bridge DVD format
      standard which provides ISO 9660 level 2 standard compatibility.
      For further information, refer to the ISO 9660 Standard Document:
      RF# ISO 9660-1988, 15 April 1988.
 
      Specific to the ISO 9660 level 2 standard, filenames on this CD
      conform to the 27.3 file naming convention i.e.,
      1.  The file name portion may be up to 29 characters long; or
      2.  The extension may be up to 29 characters long,
      3.  In no case, however, may the total file name length, including
      the . exceed 31 characters.

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      The UVIS data objects are organized into separate observations.
      Each observation contains data taken from one configuration of
      the instrument.  There may be more than one observation generated
      from one instrument configuration.  This may occur because science
      data generated by the UVIS instrument is dropped when corrupted
      data is detected or transmission failures occur.  The UVIS ground
      system detects this and divides the data into two observations, one
      terminated prior to the data drop the next beginning immediately
      afterword.  The start time and duration of an observation correspond
      to the end times of the first and last records in the observation.
      Incomplete observations are filled with zeroes.  Over 95% of data
      taken by the instrument is contained in the UVIS archive.
 
      Only one hardware feature affects UVIS data.  A light leak in the
      instrument casing causes an increase in the background counts in
      the lower half of the EUV channel wavelength range.  This effect is
      detectable by visual inspection of a graph of the data.  No tools
      for detection or correction of these background counts exists.
 
      One anomaly in the flight software caused data errors to appear
      when multiple windows which do not cover the entire EUV or FUV
      detector are defined.  In an observation, the data errors appear
      as randomly located spikes in detector count values, and one
      completely incorrect spatial line located at a random spatial
      index.  These errors are detectable by visual inspection of a
      plot of the data.  The anomaly was fixed by a revison to the
      software and effects data between launch and 2001-071 09:00:00 UTC
 
      Review
      ======
      This volume has completed a peer review by the PDS. The peer review
      panel consisted of Lyle Huber, Mitch Gordon, Steven Adams, Ron Joyner
      and Mark Vincent representing PDS, David Judd and Wayne Pryor from the,
      UVIS team Diane Connor from the Cassini Project and Kurt Retherford
      and John Clarke as outside users.
