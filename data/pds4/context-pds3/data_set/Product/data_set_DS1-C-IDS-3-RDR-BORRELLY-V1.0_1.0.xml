            This data set present plasma wave spectrometer data from the IDS
            instrument flown aboard the Deep Space 1 spacecraft. The data are
            observations of Comet 19P/Borrelly 1 obtained during the flyby of
            22 September 2001.

    Data set Overview
    =================
      On Oct 24, 1998, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft was launched as part of
      the New Millennium Project to test new technology. After the primary
      mission was completed, the spacecraft encountered comet Borrelly on
      Sept 22, 2001. The IDS sensors were reprogrammed in flight to collect
      science data at the comet and the field  measurements indicated
      events associated with dust.
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The Plasma Wave Antenna (PWA, E-field) and Search Coil Magnetometer
      (SCM, B-field) sensor channels for the IDS were calibrated with the
      flight hardware during final thermal testing. The low-frequency E-
      field and B-field spectrometer channels are based on voltage-
      controlled fourth-order band-pass filters with constant Q.
 
      Calibration signals were injected into the PWA dipole antenna leads
      at the pre-amp and the external SCM channel inputs. The calibration
      activity described herein was intended to characterize the center
      frequency, bandwidth and sensitivity of the IDS spectrometer
      channels.
 
    Calibration
    ===========
      The IDS spectrometer channel calibration was performed over the
      operating temperature range of -25C to 50C. At elevated temperatures
      (&gt;40C), internal oscillation was observed at 400-700 Hz frequency in
      the board (spectrometer). Fortunately, this board remained below 25C
      throughout most of the DS1 mission, and was approximately 15C during
      the Borrelly encounter. Little temperature sensitivity was observed
      at calibration over the temperature range -25C to 25C, thus only the
      25C calibration data was analyzed to produce the engineering unit
      conversion for the spectrometer channels.
 
    Processing
    ==========
      The PWA pre-amplifier was separately characterized with the frequency
      response determined to be flat between 200Hz and 300 MHz. The
      voltage-controlled gain was determined using an input signal at 1 KHz
      and varying the gain voltage over the operating range.
 
      The SCM sensor was characterized to provide volts/Tesla response over
      the nominal frequency range of 7 Hz to 25.6 KHz.
 
      Characterization of the spectrometer channels was performed by
      injecting       sinusoidal signals of known frequency and amplitude
      into the spectrometer. For frequency response characterization, the
      input amplitude was held constant (50 mV peak-to-peak) and the
      frequency was varied stepwise from 1 to 50 MHz in logarithmic
      fashion. A few channels were characterized with higher frequency
      resolution to verify the response of the tunable band-pass circuit.
      The frequency characterization data for Channel 7 (E-field, 780 Hz)
      is accurately fit by a fourth-order band-pass filter response
      function.
 
    Coordinate Systems
    ==================
      No coordinate is specified for the IDS data.
 
    Software
    ========
      The parsing software to reduce IDS data is not provided with the
      archive; it was upgraded in 2003.
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The standard distribution format for the data is an electronic
      volume.

        <confidence_level_note>
 
    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The high frequency filters for the E-field data are overlapping and
      can lead to cross talk which has been accounted for in the archive
      products.
 
      A significant effort was made in 2003 to upgrade the calibration
      values to prepare the data set for review.  Previously published data
      is not as that presented to the PDS in 2003.
