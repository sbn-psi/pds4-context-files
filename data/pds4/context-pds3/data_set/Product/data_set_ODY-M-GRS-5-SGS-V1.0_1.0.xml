            The ODY MARS GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETER 5 SGS (SGS) data set is a
            collection of data tables that contain a gamma spectrum and the
            associated engineering data that has been summed over 5-degree by
            5-degree latitude longitude cells on the surface of Mars and over
            a time period of 15 degrees of solar longitude (Ls). The SGS are
            produced because the individual gamma spectra collected during an
            approximately 19.7 second collection interval do not contain
            enough counts to be statistically significant. The SGS are summed
            over large enough and long enough spatial and temporal intervals
            to provide a statistically meaningful spectrum that can be used
            for scientific data analysis.

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The Mars Odyssey Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) is a suite of
      three instruments working together to collect data that will
      permit the mapping of elemental concentrations on the surface
      of Mars. The suite of three instruments, the gamma sensor head
      (GS), the neutron spectrometer (NS) and the high-energy neutron
      detector (HEND), are a complementary set of instruments in that
      the neutron instruments have better counting statistics and
      sample to a greater depth than the GS, but the GS determines the
      abundance of many more elements. A full description of the Mars
      Odyssey Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instrument can be found in
      [BOYNTONETAL2003].
 
      The ODY MARS GAMMA RAY SPECTROMETER 5 SGS (SGS) data set is a
      collection of data tables that contain a gamma spectrum and the
      associated engineering data that has been summed over 5-degree
      by 5-degree latitude longitude cells on the surface of Mars and
      over a time period of 15 degrees of solar longitude (Ls). The
      SGS are produced because the individual gamma spectra collected
      during an approximately 19.7 second collection interval do not
      contain enough counts to be statistically significant. The SGS
      are summed over large enough and long enough spatial and
      temporal intervals to provide a statistically meaningful
      spectrum that can be used for scientific data analysis.
 
      The GRS collects a new spectrum (pixel) approximately every 20
      seconds, 360 times per orbit. Approximately 4200 spectra are
      expected to be received every day. The data (both science and
      engineering) are downloaded from the spacecraft by the Jet
      Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) into the Telemetry Data System
      (TDS). The TDS sends data to a process that translates data
      packets and examines instrument health via messages. Data are
      output to a spooler that passes them to the University of
      Arizona (UA) database ingest process. The ingest process inputs
      raw data into the UA database. Gamma data are processed through
      a number of programs to yield corrected gamma spectra. The
      corrected gamma spectra are retrieved from the UA database and
      are summed into 5x5 degree grids for a time interval of 15
      degrees of Ls. The resulting sums are the SGS data products.
 
      The SGS is intended to be the second intermediate data product
      available for the gamma portion of the GRS. These data should
      be useful to those scientists who are experienced in gamma
      spectroscopy.
 
 
    Parameters
    ==========
      The SGS data set is composed of a single data type (SGS). The
      objective of compiling the SGS is to create a table of summed
      gamma data that contains enough gamma counts per channel to be
      a scientifically useful product. Because there are relatively
      few counts in each individual spectrum, it is necessary to sum
      spectra in order to accumulate enough counts to separate the
      signal peaks from the background. A correction algorithm places
      each gamma spectrum on a common energy scale. Once the spectra
      have a common energy scale, they can be summed to produce an
      SGS. Each SGS product data file will contain a 72-row table.
      The table will contain 1 data record (row) for each of the 72
      5x5 degree latitude longitude cells in a single 5-degree
      latitude band around the planet. The data files will be grouped
      by time, so that for each 15 degrees of Ls there will be one
      data directory with 36 data files representing full planet data
      coverage.
 
 
    Processing
    ==========
      A full description of the gamma data processing can be found in
      the Mars Odyssey Gamma-ray Spectrometer Gamma Data Processing
      document located in the document folder that accompanies this
      release. The following paragraphs are a summary of how the data
      are processed from data receipt through summation.
 
      GRS gamma data are downloaded from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft
      by JPL into the Telemetry Data System (TDS). The TDS sends the
      data to a process called GRS_tl, which translates GRS packets
      from any source to any destination and examines instrument
      health via messages. The data is checked for packet types,
      header information, messages, errors, engineering and
      channelized data values and is output to a spooler, which
      passes data to the UA database ingestion process. The ingestion
      process inputs raw data into the database.
 
      All data packets are processed for timing and spatial
      information. Once time data is extracted from the data packet,
      UTC time is calculated from the spacecraft event time
      (sc_ev_time) by a SPICE function. The UTC time is then inserted
      into the database. The spatial portion of the data packet is
      calculated using other SPICE routines. The returned values are
      all the spatial elements of an observation, including latitude
      and longitude at the mid-point of the observation.
 
      Engineering values have an additional step of processing. Raw
      engineering values (digital) are converted to engineering
      unit values by scaling the raw value with a stored polynomial.
      The polynomials were derived through hardware calibrations, and
      are calculated by a series of database functions.
 
      Once raw gamma data, with associated timing, spatial and
      engineering data is entered into the database, a series of
      processing steps are started to prepare the data for
      correction.
 
      The processing begins with Engineering Smoothing. The
      Engineering Smoother uses a gaussian-weighted smoothing
      algorithm to remove noise from engineering data, and inserts
      the results into the engineering database tables. The next
      process calculates the temperature for the 170k board, an
      electrical component used for signal amplification in the GS.
      This temperature must be modeled as the temperature of the
      board is not directly measured. The modeled temperature is then
      inserted into the database. The third process extracts and
      deciphers digital housekeeping information that identifies the
      state of various components on the spacecraft. The digital
      housekeeping data is needed for the corrections. The
      engineering interpolator queries the database for uncorrected
      gamma spectra records where the associated engineering data
      fields are NULL. The program queries the engineering tables for
      one record on each side of the record of interest and does a
      linear interpolation from the two engineering records to fill
      in the engineering fields in the record of interest. The next
      process, fill_apps_gain, uses the digital housekeeping
      information to insert the shaping amp gain values into each
      spectrum record. The gain values are then used by the
      corrector.
 
      The correction process calculates the gain, offset, and
      linearity of the uncorrected spectra based on measured
      temperatures of various spacecraft subsystems. Because there
      are not enough counts in any given collection interval to
      establish a calibration, the correction process uses a spectrum
      shifting algorithm to re-bin the counts in each spectrum,
      aligning the channels in all of the spectra to a common energy
      scale.
 
      The corrected spectra are then binned by space, 5-degree
      latitude and 5-degree longitude bins, and by time, 15-degree Ls
      bins. The latitude portions of the spatial bins are calculated
      from 90N to -90S. Therefore the first latitude band of sums
      calculated are centered on 87.5N. The sum is inclusive of the
      northern boundary and exclusive of the southern boundary, e.g.
      less than or equal to 90N and greater than 85N. The longitude
      portion of the sum is calculated eastward from 0 to 360.  The
      western boundary is inclusive and the eastern boundary is
      exclusive, e.g. greater than or equal to 0 and less than 5. The
      temporal bins are calculated from 0-degrees Ls, which is the
      vernal (spring) equinox within the northern hemisphere. The
      lower Ls boundary is inclusive and the upper boundary is
      exclusive, e.g. greater than or equal to 0 and less than 15.
      See the Time Conversion Tables in the document directory for
      more information on how Ls relates to spacecraft and Earth time.
 
      Once the spectra are binned, they are summed to produce a single
      SGS for each spatial and temporal bin. Any corrected spectrum
      with a bad_code greater than 0 (i.e. suspect data) is not
      included in the sum.
 
 
    Data
    ====
      The SGS data set is composed of a series of data tables labeled
      with Mars year, starting Ls, ending Ls and 5-degree latitude
      band number (0 centered on 87.5N, 35 centered on -87.5S). Each
      files contains one data table with 72 rows of data,
      corresponding to the 72 5-degree longitude bins in the latitude
      band.
 
      Summed Gamma Spectra
      -------------
 
        Summed Gamma Spectra products are composed of summed gamma
        spectra and the associated timing, spatial and engineering
        information. The SGS consists of the cumulative counts of
        gamma rays at the detector over the 5x5 degree latitude
        longitude, 15-degree Ls interval binned into 16384 channels
        based on energy. Please refer to the Corrector section of the
        Gamma Processing document located in the documents directory
        that accompanies this release for a full description of how
        gamma counts in a channel are mapped to energy. Note that the
        counts in Channel 0 are all the counts that would have been
        shifted to 0 or less than 0 by the spectrum shifting algorithm
        employed by the correction algorithm. The counts in Channel
        16383 are all the counts with energies greater than 10MeV, and
        counts in Channel 16382 are all the counts that belong in
        either 16382 or would have been shifted to 16383 by the
        correction algorithm. The timing and spatial data provided
        with the spectra include the time and spatial range over
        which the sum was generated.
 
 
    Ancillary Data
    ==============
      Ancillary data needed to understand the gamma data processing,
      can be found in the Mars Odyssey Gamma-ray Spectrometer Gamma
      Data Processing document located in the document folder that
      accompanies this release.
 
 
    Coordinate System
    =================
      The coordinate system used for all GRS data is a Mars
      areocentric system following the IAU convention
      [SEIDELMANNETAL2002], with east longitudes from 0 to 360.
 
 
    Software
    ========
      A library of source code to parse the SGS data product files
      is included in the software directory. This library allows a
      programmer to build applications that display or manipulate
      SGS data. This source is written in the Java language, and
      requires version 1.3 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or
      Java Software Development Kit (SDK).
 
      Documentation for the code is located in the software directory
      in the file GRS_DR_CODE_DOC.ZIP. The contents of this file are
      described in the label GRS_DR_CODE_DOC.LBL and the source and
      the binary classes that make up the library are in the file
      DR_CODE.JAR.
 
    Media/Format
    ============
      The SGS will be delivered electronically. Formats will be
      based on standards established by the Planetary Data
      System (PDS) [PDSSR2001].
        </data_set_desc>
        <confidence_level_note>
 
    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The data presented in the SGS is intended to be the second
      intermediate data set released for the GRS. Data presented here
      are a highly processed and re-binned representation of the GRS
      data. It is possible that changes will be made in the processing
      and correction procedures that the SGS products are based on if
      errors are found. If errors are found, the data will have to be
      regenerated from the corrected data set.
 
 
    Review
    ======
      The SGS was reviewed internally by the GRS team prior to
      release to the PDS. PDS will also perform an external review of
      the SGS.
 
 
    Data Coverage and Quality
    =========================
      Data reported are the processed and re binned gamma data
      received
      from the spacecraft during the mapping mission stage. Data
      coverage and quality are addressed in the following sections.
 
 
      Primary Mapping
      ---------------
      The Mapping portion of the mission began February 19, 2002, and
      is expected to last until August, 2004. Primary mapping is
      broken into two phases: stowed mapping and deployed mapping.
 
        Stowed Mapping
        --------------
          The stowed mapping configuration began on February 19, 2002
          and lasted until June 1, 2002. The stowed mapping
          configuration is with the Odyssey spacecraft in a mapping
          orbit, with the GRS in data collection configuration without
          the 6-meter boom deployed. The reason for data collection in
          the stowed configuration is to measure the background signal
          from the spacecraft.
 
          During the stowed mapping portion of the mission, two
          anneals were performed on the gamma detector.  The anneals
          were performed between March 8, 2002 to March 22, 2002 and
          May 6, 2002 to May 20, 2002. No science data was collected
          during these two periods. On June 1, 2002 the GRS was
          shutdown to prepare for boom deployment, which occurred on
          June 4, 2002. There may also be short periods of missing
          data due to missing telemetry that cannot be recovered.
 
        Deployed Mapping
        ----------------
          Deployed Mapping began on June 5, 2002 and is expected to
          continue until at least August, 2004.  Gamma data collected
          on June 19, 2002 are suspect due a number of temperature
          fluctuations in the gamma subsystem.
 
          A number of solar particle events have been recorded. Gamma
          Data collected during these times are suspect:

          Gamma Data collected during solar flare events are also
          suspect:

          Gamma Data collected over the time interval
 
                      11/05/02 01:48:04 to 11/28/02 08:00:00
 
          are suspect due to a safe mode of the spacecraft, and the
          subsequent high temperature anneal of the gamma detector.
 
          There are short data gaps due to missing telemetry that
          cannot be recovered.
 
          Any single spectrum with a bad code greater than 0 should
          be treated with caution, as it may not be suitable for
          further processing.  Refer to the Auto_Bad section in the
          Mars Odyssey Gamma-ray Spectrometer Gamma Data
          Processing document located in the documents folder
          that accompanies this release for further details.
 
  Limitations
  ===========
    The major limitation of this data set is that it is derived from
    the raw minimally processed data. The data is received from
    spacecraft telemetry, and ingested into a database. If gaps exist
    in the telemetry, data is lost. Timing and spatial components of
    the data set rely on the accuracy of the NAIF SPICE kernels. The
    validity of the corrected gamma spectra is based on the
    &apos;correctness&apos; of each step in the processing. It is possible that
    changes will be made in the processing and correction procedure if
    errors are found. If errors are found, the data will have to be
    regenerated from the raw unprocessed data set.
 
  Data Compression
  ===============
    No compression is used on the SGS data set.
 
  Caveat
  ======
    The SGS data products that have been released to the PDS in the
    November 1, 2003 release were created using CGS spectra that were
    produced with the original correction algorithm (in the same
    manner as the releases with data taken before January 1, 2003).
    The SGS data products will be re-released with the new correction
    once this correction has been fully validated for the entire data
    set and propagated through the GRS database. See the caveat in the
    CGS data set description for details on the differences between
    the old correction method and the new one.
