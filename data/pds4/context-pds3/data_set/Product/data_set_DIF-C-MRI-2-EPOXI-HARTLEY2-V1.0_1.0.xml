  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains raw images of comet 103/P Hartley 2 acquired by
    the Medium Resolution Visible CCD (MRI) from 05 September through 26
    November 2010 during the Hartley 2 encounter phase of the EPOXI mission.
    Clear-filter and CN images of the comet were acquired throughout this
    phase; OH, C2, and dust continuum images were only acquired for several
    days spanning closest approach.
 
    The following list summarizes the comet observations in this dataset.
    Descriptive text for each activity is included below.  Additionally,
    the MRI Hartley 2 Flyby (E-18 hours to E+2 days) Log in the DOCUMENT
    directory provides the imaging sequence and notes about image quality
    that were recorded by the science team as the data arrived on the
    ground.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *  Data acquired on 06 Oct were never downlinked due to a pointing problem
       with the Deep Space Network (DSN).
    ** First cycle of 28 Oct, only six hourly scans were taken before the
       sequence stopped and restarted at &apos;dosido&apos; section for 7 hourly
       scans.  Therefore the middle 11 scans were not acquired on
       purpose.  Some frames in a scan may be missing because they were
       scheduled for transmission after the HGA was turned off, i.e. loss
       of signal.  Any data the DSN received after this were considered
       extra credit.
 
    Hartley 2 Approach Imaging, E-60 to E-50 Days (VIS only):  The MRI and
      HRIV visible CCDs began imaging 103P/Hartley 2 every six hours on 05
      September 2010, 60 days before the encounter (E-60 days) encounter
      and continued for 10 days.  However due to thermal issues with a
      traveling wave tube amplifier the entire HRI system including the
      HRIV CCD was turned off on 06 September until 20 September.  MRI
      continued its imaging sequence as planned through E-50 days.  The
      comet was observed for 16 hours at a time with 8 hours devoted to
      downlinking the data.
 
    Hartley 2 Approach Imaging, E-50 to E-40 Days (VIS only):  From 15 to
      25 September 2010, the imaging cadence for MRI increased to every
      two hours.  On 20 September the HRIV CCD was turned on, and it begin
      imaging 103P/Hartley 2 once every two hours for the duration of the
      period.  The comet was observed for 16 hours at a time with 8 hours
      devoted to downlinking the data.
 
    Hartley 2 Approach Imaging, E-34 to E-8 Days (Start HRII):  From 01
      to 28 October 2010, MRI and HRIV imaged 103P/Hartley 2 about
      every 5 minutes while the HRII spectrometer scanned for outbursts
      once every 30 minutes.  The instruments observed the comet for 16
      hours per day allowing for 8 hours of downlinking; the same sequence
      was repeated daily yielding one full cycle per day.  Data from the
      6th cycle on 06 October 2010 (DOY 279) were never downlinked because
      of a pointing problem with the Deep Space Network.  Those data had
      to be erased on board the spacecraft to make room for the next daily
      cycle and could not be recovered.
 
    Hartley 2 Approach Imaging, E-8 Days to E-18 Hours:  From 28 October
      to 03 November 2010, the MRI and HRIV imaged 103P/Hartley 2
      continuously and HRII scanned the comet about every hour for 16
      hours per day allowing for 8 hours of downlinking punctuated by
      hourly maneuvers, called dosido, to observe the comet. During this
      imaging phase there was only a single downlink of all images with
      zero margin; thus some images were occasionally lost as expected.
      The first cycle (DOY 300/301) was abbreviated such that the first
      comet-imaging session was only 6-hours long, followed by the
      standard 8-hour dosido.
 
    Hartley 2 Encounter Imaging, E-18 hours to E+2 Days:  From 03 to 06
      November 2010, the HRII, HRIV, and MRI performed high resolution
      encounter imaging of 103P/Hartley2.  The HRIV and MRI instruments
      began sampling about once every two hours until one hour before
      encounter when the cadence changed to once every 15 minutes.  At E-30
      minutes the instruments began continuously imaging of the comet.  At
      E+30 minutes simultaneous observing and data playback began with
      samples being taken every 30 minutes.  During the encounter imaging
      period, HRII infrared scans occurred every two hours until four hours
      prior to encounter when the cadence increased to hourly then more
      frequently one hour before closest approach.  About one hour after
      closest approach, regular infrared sampling at 30-minute intervals
      resumed.
 
      On 04 November near closest approach, MRI obtained two, contiguous,
      full color sets (CN, OH, C2, IR, Red, and dust continuum filters)
      at a scale &lt; 550 m/pixel (the exposure IDs are provided):
 
        5002027 - 5002036 (E-09 min, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~83-70 m/pixel)
        5006057 - 5006065 (E+09 min, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~83-70 m/pixel)
 
      Also on 04 November, MRI obtained broadband, clear-filter images of
      the nucleus with a scale &lt; 10 m/pixel:
 
        6000001 (E-35 sec, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~8 m/pixel)
        5004046 (E-06 sec, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~7 m/pixel)
        6000002 (E-01 sec, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~7 m/pixel)
        5004051 (E+03 sec, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~7 m/pixel)
        6000003 (E+37 sec, Full Frame/Mode 1, ~8 m/pixel)
 
      Although there was an error in how the spacecraft was commanded to
      point during closest approach the nucleus remained in the field of
      view of all MRI frames acquired at that time.
 
    Hartley 2 Departure Imaging, E+2 to E+12 Days:  From 06 to 16 November
      2010, the HRII spectrometer scanned 103P/Hartley 2 every ~15 minutes
      while the MRI CCD imaged the comet every 2 minutes and HRIV once
      every hour.
 
    Hartley 2 Departure Imaging, E+12 to E+21 Days:  From 16 to 26 November
      2010, the HRII spectrometer scanned 103P/Hartley 2 every 30 minutes,
      and HRIV performed rotation sampling at the same cadence.  MRI
      performed rotation sampling every 30 minutes and imaging using gas
      filters every two to four hours.

  Processing
  ==========
    The raw two-dimensional FITS CCD images and PDS labels in this data
    set were generated by the Deep Impact/EPOXI data pipeline, maintained
    by the project&apos;s Science Data Center (SDC) at Cornell University.
    The FITS data were assembled from raw telemetry packets sent down by
    the flyby spacecraft.  Information from the embedded spacecraft
    header (the first 100 bytes of quadrant A image data) was extracted
    and stored in the primary FITS header.  Geometric parameters were
    computed using the best available SPICE kernels and the results were
    also stored in the FITS header.  If telemetry packets were missing,
    the corresponding pixels were flagged as missing in the quality map
    included as a FITS image extension.  The quadrant nomenclature and the
    image quality map are described in the EPOXI SIS document.  The SDC
    did not apply any type of correction or decompression algorithm to the
    raw data.
 
 
  Data
  ====
 
    FITS Images and PDS Labels
    --------------------------
      Each raw MRI image is stored as FITS.  The primary data unit contains
      the two-dimensional CCD image.  It is followed by one image extension
      that contains a two-dimensional pixel-by-pixel quality map.  This
      extension uses one byte of eight bit flags to indicate the quality of
      each pixel in the primary image.  The data label provides a short
      description of each bit.  For more information about the FITS primary
      image and its extension or for examples of how to access and use the
      quality flags, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
      Each FITS file is accompanied by a detached PDS data label.  The
      EPOXI SIS document provides definitions for the keywords found in
      a PDS data label.  Many values in a label were extracted from
      FITS image header keywords which are defined in the document
      EPOXI_FITS_KEYWORD_DESC.ASC found in the Deep Impact and EPOXI
      documentation dataset, DI-C-HRII/HRIV/MRI/ITS-6-DOC-SET-V3.0.
 
 
    File Naming Convention
    ----------------------
      The naming convention for the raw data labels and FITS files is
      MVyymmddhh_eeeeeee_nnn.LBL or FIT where &apos;MV&apos; identifies the MRI
      instrument, yymmddhh provides the UTC year, month, day, and hour at
      the mid-point of the observation, eeeeeee is the exposure ID
      (OBSERVATION_ID in data labels), and nnn provides the image number
      (IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels) within the exposure ID.
 
      Up to 999 individual images or frames can be commanded for one
      exposure ID.  Therefore, nnn in the file name provides the
      sequentially increasing frame number within an exposure ID and
      corresponds to IMAGE_NUMBER in the data labels.  For example, if 7
      frames were commanded for a scan with an exposure ID of 4000001, the
      first FITS file name would be MV10090513_4000001_001.FIT and the last
      would be MV10090513_4000001_007.FIT.
 
 
    Image Compression
    -----------------
      For some MRI frames the raw data numbers were compressed on board
      the flyby spacecraft by use of a lookup table then downlinked,
      processed, and archived in the same format.  A compressed image is
      identified by the value &apos;COMPRESSED&apos; in the COMPRESSED_IMAGE_VALUE
      keyword in the data labels or the COMPRESS keyword in the FITS
      headers.  See the EPOXI SIS and EPOXI Hartley 2 Calibration Pipeline
      Summary documents as well as Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006]
      for more information.
 
 
    Image Orientation
    -----------------
      A true-sky &apos;as seen by the observer&apos; view is achieved by displaying
      the image using the standard FITS convention:  the fastest-varying
      axis (samples or wavelength) increasing to the right in the display
      window and the slowest-varying axis (lines or spatial/along-slit)
      increasing to the top.  This convention is identified in the data
      labels:  the SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION keyword is set to RIGHT and
      LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION to UP.
 
      The direction to celestial north, ecliptic north, and the Sun is
      provided in data labels by CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE,
      ECLIPTIC_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE, and SUN_DIRECTION_CLOCK_ANGLE keywords
      and are measured clockwise from the top of the image when is
      displayed in the correct orientation as defined by
      SAMPLE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION and LINE_DISPLAY_DIRECTION.  Please note
      the aspect of the North celestial pole in an image can be computed
      by adding 90 degrees to the boresight declination given by
      DECLINATION in the data labels.
 
      For a comparison of the orientation FITS image data from the three
      science instruments, see the quadrant nomenclature section of the
      the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
    Instrument Alignment
    --------------------
      For a comparison of the field of view and the relative boresight
      alignment of MRI to the High Resolution Instrument Visible CCD
      (HRIV) and the slit of the High Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer
      (HRII), see the instrument alignment section of the EPOXI SIS
      document or Klaasen, et al. (2011) [KLAASENETAL2011].

      the values for MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, MEDIAN, and STANDARD_DEVIATION in
      the data labels.  These overclock areas described in the Deep
      Impact instruments document and the Deep Impact instrument

    Time- and Geometry-Related Keywords
    -----------------------------------
      All time-related keywords in the data labels, except
      EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME, are based on the clock on board the flyby
      spacecraft.  EARTH_OBSERVER_MID_TIME provides the UTC when an
      Earth-based observer should have been able to see an event recorded
      by the instrument.
 
      The SDC pipeline was not able to automatically determine the proper
      geometric information for the target of choice in some cases.  When
      these parameters could not be computed, the corresponding keywords
      in the data labels are set to a value of unknown, &apos;UNK&apos;.  Also if
      GEOMETRY_QUALITY_FLAG is set to &apos;BAD&apos; or GEOMETRY_TYPE is set to
      &apos;PREDICTED&apos; in the PDS labels, then this indicates the geometry
      values may not be accurate and should be used with caution.  The
      value &apos;N/A&apos; is used for some geometry-related keywords in the data
      labels because these parameters are not applicable for certain
      calibration targets.
 
      Observational geometry parameters provided in the data labels were
      computed at the epoch specified by the mid-obs UTC, IMAGE_MID_TIME,
      in the data labels.  The exceptions are the target-to-sun values
      evaluated at the time light left the target that reached the
      spacecraft at mid-obs time and the earth-observer-to-target values
      evaluated at the time the light that left the target, which reached
      the spacecraft at mid-obs time, reached Earth.
 
 
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    The geometric parameters included in the data labels and FITS headers
    were computed using the best available SPICE kernels at the time the
    data products were generated.  The kernels are archived in the
    EPOXI SPICE dataset, DIF-C/E/X-SPICE-6-V1.0.
 
 
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Earth Mean Equator and Vernal Equinox of J2000 (EME J2000) is the
    inertial reference system used to specify observational geometry
    parameters in the data labels.
 
 
  Software
  ========
    The observations in this dataset are in standard FITS format with PDS
    labels, and can be viewed by a number of PDS-provided and commercial
    programs.  For this reason no special software is provided with this
    dataset.

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The FITS files in this dataset were reviewed internally by the EPOXI
    project and were used extensively to verify the calibration of the
    instrument.
 
 
  Review
  ======
    This dataset was peer reviewed and certified for scientific use on
    15 August 2011.
 
 
  Data Coverage and Quality
  =========================
    There are no unexpected gaps in this dataset, except those that
    occurred on 06 and 28 October 2011 as noted in the dataset overview.
    All science frames received on the ground were processed and included
    in this dataset.
 
    Some frames (exposures IDs) in this dataset are repeatedly smeared
    because the spacecraft was in motion due to an HRII spectrometer
    scan.
 
    Horizontal striping through some images indicates missing data.  The
    image quality map extension identifies where pixels are missing.  If
    the second most-significant bit of a pixel in the image quality map is
    turned on, then data for the corresponding image pixel is missing.  For
    more information, refer to the EPOXI SIS document.
 
 
  Limitations
  ===========
 
    Timing
    ------
      The flyby spacecraft clock SPICE kernels (SCLK) used to convert to
      UTC and to calculate geometry-related parameters for this dataset
      have a known accuracy of no better than 0.5 seconds.  However the
      latest SCLK (science version 84) applied to the Hartley 2 encounter
      data is good to within 0.01 seconds for converting the spacecraft
      timestamps to ephemeris time for observations acquired around
      closest approach.  Please note that the SCLK (version 65) used to
      compute UTC values and geometry for calibration data acquired from
      January 2009 through July 2010 has known discontinuities of up to a
      second.  Those discontinuities have been corrected in the latest
      SCLK, science version 84, applied to Hartley data.
 
      The mission operations team has figured out how to correct raw clock
      correlation data for the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft to allow
      timing fits that are accurate to well under the sub-second level as
      evidenced by the 0.01-second accuracy around the time the Hartley 2
      encounter.  The EPOXI project plans to use this method to generate a
      complete and highly accurate set of UTC correlations for the flyby
      spacecraft since the launch, resulting in a future version of a SCLK
      kernel that will retroactively change correlation for **all** Deep
      Impact and EPOXI data.  When this kernel is available, it will be
      added to the SPICE datasets for the two missions and posted on the
      NAIF/SPICE web site at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/.  The EPOXI
      project will provide more precise times for archived data as time
      and funding permit.
 
 
    CCD Horizontal Gap
    ------------------
      Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data
      determined the two halves of the MRI CCD - the boundary being the
      two horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while
      physically consistent across the boundary, are 1/6 of a pixel
      smaller vertically than a normal row.  Therefore, reconstructed
      images, which have uniform row spacing, have a 1/3-pixel extension
      introduced at the center of the array.  Thus for two features on
      either side of the midpoint line, the vertical component of the
      actual angular separation between those features is one-third of a
      pixel less than their measured difference in vertical pixels in the
      image.  As for all geometric distortions, correction of this
      distortion will require resampling of the image and an attendant
      loss in spatial resolution.  The standard pipeline process does
      not perform this correction so as to preserve the best spatial
      resolution.
 
      The two 1/6-pixel narrower central rows collect only 5/6 of the
      charge of a normal row.  This effect is corrected by the flat-field
      division for calibrated science images so that the pixels in these
      rows have the correct scene radiance assigned to them.  However,
      point-source or disk-integrated photometric measurements using
      aperture photometry areas that include these central rows will be
      slightly distorted unless special adjustments are made.  For
      example, the aperture photometry process for comet 9P/Tempel 1 added
      an extra 1/6-pixel worth of signal to the to the pixels in each of
      these two rows in the reconstructed, calibrated images as described
      in Appendix A of Belton, et al., (2011) [BELTONETAL2011].
 
 
    Displaying Images
    -----------------
      Flight software writes an image header over the first 100 bytes of
      quadrant A.  These image header pixels were included in the raw
      FITS images.  Since the values in these pixels vary dramatically,
      it is recommended that the values of the MINIMUM and MAXIMUM
      keywords in the data label (or the MINPVAL and MAXPVAL in the FITS
      header) be used to scale an image for display because these values
      exclude the header bytes as well as the overclock rows and columns
      located around the edge of the CCD image.  For more information,
      see the quadrant nomenclature section of the EPOXI SIS document.
