A HISTORY object is a dynamic description of the history of
one or more associated data objects in a file.  It
supplements the essentially static description contained in
the PDS label.
The HISTORY object contains text in a
format similar to that of the ODL statements used in the
label.  It identifies previous computer manipulation of 
the principal data object(s) in the file.  It includes an
identification of the source data, processes performed,
processing parameters, as well as dates and times of
processing.  It is intended that the history be available
for display, be dynamically extended by any process
operating on the data, and automatically propagated to the
resulting data file.  Eventually, it might be extracted for
loading in detailed level catalogs of data set contents.
The HISTORY object is structured as a series of History
Entries, one for each process which has operated on the
data.  Each entry contains a standard set of   ODL element
assignment statements, delimited by GROUP = program_name
and END_GROUP = program_name statements.  A subgroup in
each entry, delimited by GROUP = PARAMETERS and END_GROUP =
PARAMETERS, contains statements specifying the values of
all parameters of the program.
HISTORY ENTRY ELEMENTS
Attribute       Description
VERSION_DATE    Program version date, ISO standard format.
DATE_TIME       Run date and time, ISO standard format.
NODE_NAME       Network name of computer
USER_NAME       Username.
SOFTWARE_DESC   Program-generated (brief) description.
USER_NOTE       User-supplied (brief) description.
Unlike the above
elements, the names of the parameters defined in the
PARAMETERS subgroup are uncontrolled, and must only conform
to the program.
The last entry in a HISTORY object is
followed by an END statement.  The HISTORY object, by
convention, follows the PDS label of the file, beginning on
a record boundary, and is located by a pointer statement in
the label. There are no required elements for the PDS label
description of the object; it is represented in the label
only by the pointer statement, and OBJECT = HISTORY and
END_OBJECT = HISTORY statements.
The HISTORY capability
has been implemented as part of the Integrated Software for
Imaging Spectrometers (ISIS) system (see QUBE object
definition).  ISIS Qube applications add their own entries
to the Qube file&apos;s cumulative History object.  ISIS
programs run under NASA&apos;s TAE (Transportable Applications
Executive) system, and are able to automatically insert all
parameters of their TAE procedure into the history entry
created by the program.  Consult the ISIS System Design
document for details and limitations imposed by that
system.  (See the QUBE object description for further
references.)
