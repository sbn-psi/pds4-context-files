Note that the SPECTRAL_QUBE described here is specifically a PDS
SPECTRAL_QUBE.  While similar to the ISIS Qube, it is not identical.
(For guidelines on producing a spectral qube that is compliant with
both PDS and ISIS, see the SPECTRAL_QUBE chapter of Appendix A of the
PDS Standards Reference.)
 
The SPECTRAL_QUBE object is a three-dimensional object with two
spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension.  The axes have the
interpretations &apos;sample&apos;, &apos;line&apos;, and &apos;band&apos;, respectively.
 
Each of the three axes in a SPECTRAL_QUBE object may optionally
include suffix data that extend the length of the axis.  Conceptually,
this can be viewed as forming one or more suffix planes that are
attached to the core qube.  Suffix planes that extend the band
dimension are called BACKPLANES.  Suffix planes that extend the sample
dimension are called SIDEPLANES.  Suffix planes that extend the line
dimension are called BOTTOMPLANES.
 
Note that these terms refer to the &apos;logical&apos; axes -- that is, how the
axes are conceptually modeled -- and are not necessarily related to
the physical storage of the SPECTRAL_QUBE object.  The suffix planes
are used for storing auxiliary data that are associated with the core
data.  For example, a backplane might be used for storing the latitude
values for each spatial-spatial pixel.  Another backplane might be
used for storing the wavelength of the deepest absorption feature that
was found in the spectrum at each spatial-spatial pixel.  One or more
SIDEPLANES might be used for storing engineering data that are
associated with each spatial line.
 
Within the logical structure of the SPECTRAL_QUBE, SAMPLE=1 is the
left edge of the spatial-spatial core image.  LINE=1 is the top edge
of the spatial-spatial core image.  BAND=1 corresponds to the
spatial-spatial images at the &apos;front&apos; of the qube.  Core coordinates
do not carry over to the suffix regions.
 
The file in which a SPECTRAL_QUBE data object is stored is physically
access as though it were a one-dimensional data structure.  Storing
the SPECTRAL_QUBE thus requires that the &apos;logical&apos; three-dimensional
structure be mapped into the one-dimensional physical file structure.
This involves moving through the three-dimensional structure in
certain patterns to determine the linear sequence of core and suffix
pixel values that occur in the file.  In SPECTRAL_QUBE files, this
pattern is defined by specifying which axis index varies fastest in
the linear sequence of pixel values in the file, which axis varies
second fastest, and which axis varies slowest.
 
In SPECTRAL_QUBE files, the names of the three axes are always SAMPLE,
LINE, and BAND.  The AXIS_NAME keyword has an array of values that
list the names of the axes in the qube.  The order of the names
specifies the qube storage order in the file.  The first axis is the
fastest varying, and the third axis is the slowest varying.  The
SPECTRAL_QUBE supports the following three storage order:
 
- (SAMPLE, LINE, BAND) - Band Sequential (BSQ)
- (SAMPLE, BAND, LINE) - Band Interleaved by Line (BIL)
- (BAND, SAMPLE, LINE) - Band Interleaved by Pixel (BIP)
 
The lengths of the core axes are given by the CORE_ITEMS keyword and
the lengths of the suffix axes are given by the SUFFIX_ITEMS keyword.
Both these keywords have array values, whose order corresponds to the
order of the axes given by the AXIS_NAME keyword.
 
In the physical file storage, suffix pixel data (if present) are
interspersed with the associated core pixel data.  For example, in a
BSQ storage order file, the physical qube storage in the file begins
with the pixels in the first (top) line of the spatial-spatial image
plane at the first wavelength band.  This is followed by the sideplane
pixel values that extend this line of core pixels.  Next are the core
pixels for the second line, followed by the sideplane pixels for the
second line.  After the last line of this first core image plane (and
its associated sideplane pixels) comes the bottomplane pixels
associated with the first band.  This is then repeated for the second
through last bands.  Finally, all the backplane data are stored after
all the core data and associated sideplane and bottomplane pixels.
 
If a SPECTRAL_QUBE file includes suffixes on more than one axis, then
the region that is the intersection between two (or all three) of the
suffix regions is called a CORNER region.  The PDS requires that space
for CORNER region data be allocated in the data files.  However, this
space is never actually used.
 
In a SPECTRAL_QUBE file, core pixels can occupy one, two or four
bytes.  All core pixels within a single file must be of the same
physical storage size.  Suffix pixels can also occupy one, two, or
four bytes of storage in the file.  All the suffix pixels within a
single file must be of the same physical storage size.  Suffix pixels
need not be the same size as core pixels.  Handling of different pixel
data types is described in detail below.
 
In SPECTRAL_QUBE files, core pixel values can be represented by one of
several formats.  The formats available are dependent on the number of
bytes used to store the values in the file.  The format is given by
the CORE_ITEM_TYPE keyword and the number of bytes stored is given by
the CORE_ITEM_BYTES keyword.  The following table shows the allowable
formats and the number of bytes of storage the use:
 
CORE_ITEM_BYTES     CORE_ITEM_TYPE    Type Conversion
                                        Parameters
  1, 2, or 4       UNSIGNED_INTEGER        Yes
  1, 2, or 4     MSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER      Yes
  1, 2, or 4     LSB_UNSIGNED_INTEGER      Yes
  1, 2, or 4           INTEGER             Yes
  1, 2, or 4         MSB_INTEGER           Yes
  1, 2, or 4         LSB_INTEGER           Yes
       4              IEEE_REAL             No
       4               VAX_REAL             No
       4               PC_REAL              No
 
As the table above indicates, stored integer values can be converted
to real values, representing the actual pixel.  The type conversion
parameters are given by the CORE_BASE and CORE_MULTIPLIER keywords,
and the real value being represented is determined as follows:
 
  &apos;real_value&apos; = CORE_BASE + (CORE_MULTIPLIER * REAL(stored_value))
 
For 4-byte real formats, the stored values are floating point values
that directly represent the pixel values.
 
The same data types and number of storage bytes that are shown in the
above table are also available to suffix pixels.  However, suffix
pixels need not be the same size or have the same data type as the
core pixels.  Therefore, there is a SUFFIX_ITEM_BYTES keyword to
indicate the number of bytes stored for suffix pixels and a
SUFFIX_ITEM_TYPE keyword to describe the data type of the suffix
pixels.  Each suffix plane within a single file can have a different
data format.  Thus, the values of these keywords are arrays.  Each
element of the array refers to a separate suffix plane.
 
The SPECTRAL_QUBE allows the number of bytes used to store data in
each suffix pixel (SUFFIX_ITEM_BYTES) to be less than the total number
of bytes allowcated to each suffix pixel (SUFFIX_BYTES).  It is
therefore necessary to describe how the stored bytes are aligned
within the allocated bytes.  The BIT_MASK keyword is used for this
purpose.
 
Note that in the following list of required and optional objects and
groups, while the *_SUFFIX groups are listed as optional, they are
required if their named axis appears in the qube.
