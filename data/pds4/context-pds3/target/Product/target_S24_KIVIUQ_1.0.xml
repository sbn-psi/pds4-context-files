        &amp;apos;S24 KIVIUQ&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;KIVIUQ&amp;apos; refer to the same target.
 
        Kiviuq is a prograde irregular satellite of Saturn. It was discovered
        by Brett J. Gladman in 2000, and given the temporary designation
        S/2000 S 5.
 
        It was named in 2003 after a &amp;apos;giant&amp;apos; of Inuit mythology. Kiviuq
        (also spelled Keeveeok, Qiviuq or Kivioq) is a legendary and heroic
        Inuk, a sort of Inuit Odysseus. He has lived very long (or has had
        several lives), has wandered and journeyed, living all sorts of
        adventures whose details depend on the story-teller&amp;apos;s local tradition.
 
        Kiviuq is about 16 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an
        average distance of 11.1 million kilometers in 450 days. It is a
        member of the Inuit group of irregular satellites.
 
        Kiviuq displays light-red colours and the infrared spectrum very
        similar to Siarnaq and Paaliaq, further supporting the thesis of a
        possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a larger
        body.
 
        Kiviuq is believed to be in Kozai resonance i.e. cyclically reducing
        the orbital inclination while increasing the eccentricity and vice
        versa.
