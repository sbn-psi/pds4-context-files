Aegaeon, also Saturn LIII (provisional designation S/2008 S 1), is a natural
satellite of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Carolyn Porco of the
Cassini Imaging Science Team on March 3, 2009, from observations taken on
August 15, 2008.
 
Aegaeon orbits within the bright segment of Saturn&amp;apos;s G Ring, and is likely a
major source of the ring. Debris knocked off the moon forms a bright arc near
the inner edge, which in turn spreads to form the rest of the ring. Aegaeon
orbits in a 7:6 resonance with Mimas, which causes a about 4-year oscillation
of about 4 km in its semi-major axis. Assuming it has the same albedo as
Pallene, it is estimated to be half a kilometer in diameter. It orbits Saturn
at an average distance of 167,500 km in 0.80812 days, at an inclination of
0.001 degrees to Saturn&amp;apos;s equator, with an eccentricity of 0.0002.
 
It is named after Aegaeon, one of the hecatonchires.
