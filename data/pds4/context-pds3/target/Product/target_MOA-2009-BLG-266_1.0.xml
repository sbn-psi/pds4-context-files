    Target Description
    ==================
      MOA-2009-BLG-266 is low-mass exoplanet detected by gravitational
      microlensing parallax measurements by chance alignment with a
      lensing star estimated to be 0.5 or 0.7 solar masses and located
      about 3 kiloparsecs from Earth in the galactic disk at these
      J2000 coordinates:
 
         RA:   17:48:01.95
        Dec:  -35:00:19.48
 
      The planet is estimated to be about 10 Earth masses and at a
      distance of approximately 3 AU from its host.  The microlensing
      event is long, lasting several months; the Einstein ring has a
      radius of about 4 AU.
 
      MOA-2009-BLG-266 was first detected on 11 September 2009 by
      Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA), a joint project
      between New Zealand and Japan at Mount John Observatory.  It is
      also the first planetary microlensing event with extra-terrestrial
      observations performed by EPOXI mission in October 2009 (data on
      trailing arm of event).
