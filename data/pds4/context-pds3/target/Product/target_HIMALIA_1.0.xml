Himalia [hih-MAL-yuh] is the tenth known satellite of Jupiter. It was
discovered by Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory on 1904
December 3.  It is the brightest of Jupiter&amp;apos;s outer satellites. Himalia
is most likely an irregularly shaped asteroid that was captured into
orbit around Jupiter. In mythology, Himalia was a nymph who bore three
sons of Zeus (Jupiter).
 
Himalia did not receive its present name until 1975 before then, it was
simply known as Jupiter VI or Jupiter Satellite VI.
 
The brightest of Jupiter&amp;apos;s outer satellites, Himalia, was captured and
resolved, for the first time, in a series of narrow angle images taken on
December 19, 2000 from a distance of 4.4 million kilometers during the
brief period when Cassini&amp;apos;s attitude was stabilized by thrusters instead
of reaction wheels. It is likely that Himalia is not spherical: it is
believed to be a body captured into orbit around Jupiter and as such,
is likely to be an irregularly shaped asteroid.
