  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
 
    The Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO) is primarily intended for
    astronomical research and is composed of two facilities, a single
    2.4-Meter telescope and an array of optical/infrared telescopes called
    an Interferometer. It is located on South Baldy Ridge in the Magdalena
    mountains, some 30 miles west of the New Mexico Tech (NMT) campus. At
    an elevation of 10,600 ft. above sea level, it is the fourth
    highest observatory in the world.
 
    The MRO 2.4-meter Telescope is primarily utilized to observe,
    track, and characterize solar system astronomical targets, Earth
    satellites, space vehicles, and terrestrial military targets.
 
    The 2.4-meter telescope has three basic objectives:
 
        * Classical astronomical research
        * DoD mission support (satellite remote sensing,
          space surveillance, and missile tracking)
        * Supporting and enhancing education and public outreach
 
    The telescope&apos;s rapid tracking (slew rates are 10 degrees/sec)
    capability facilitates characterization studies of resident space
    objects in low-Earth orbits. Further, the facility can be used to
    respond to targets of opportunity that occur in asteroid studies (e.g.,
    Near Earth Objects) and in astrophysics, such as gamma ray bursts and
    other transient phenomena. Instrumentation includes a 4k x 4k CCD imager
    (with a standard UBVRI Bessel broadband filter set) and a high frame
    rate Andor Technology CCD camera, which is on loan from Williams
    College. The 4K imager&apos;s field of view extends to 11 arc minutes square,
    and this system has a 5-sigma detection limit of V~24.
 
    First light for the 2.4 meter telescope occurred on October 31, 2006,
    and the observatory transitioned to an operational phase in September
    2008.
 
    The telescope was manufactured by EOS Technologies, Inc. (Tucson,
    Arizona); the architectural and engineering firm that designed the
    support structures for the project was Dekker/Perich/Sabatini
    (Albuquerque, NM); the telescope foundation was done by AUI, Inc.
    (Albuquerque, NM); the pier, telescope enclosure, and control building
    was constructed by Rio Conchos Corporation (Albuquerque, New Mexico);
    and the 40-foot, fast-tracking dome for the telescope enclosure was
    manufactured by Observa-Dome (Jackson, MS).
