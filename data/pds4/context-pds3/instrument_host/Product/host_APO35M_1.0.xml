  Instrument Host Overview
  ========================
 
    The Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-meter telescope is located at
    the Apache Point Observatory in the Sacramento Mountains in Sunspot, NM.
    The observatory stands at an altitude of 2788 meters, latitude 32.8
    degrees N, and longitude 105.8 degrees W.
 
    The following sections provide an overview of the 3.5-meter telescope
    and the APO Facility, which supports the data acquisition.
 
 
    3.5-meter Telescope
    ===================
 
    The telescope enclosure consists of three levels: ground, intermediate,
    and observing.  The ground level provides access to the lower telescope
    pier, cone room, and general storage.  The intermediate level provides
    access to instrument racks, enclosure drive motors, and telescope
    hydraulics.  The observing level provides access to the telescope,
    instruments, and enclosure hoists.  The enclosure is joined to the
    operations building by an arcade.
 
    The ARC 3.5-meter telescope is designed with an altitude-azimuth mount.
    The primary and secondary mirrors provide a working f/number of 10.4 and
    an effective focal length of 35238.7 mm.  The telescope was designed to
    host various instruments simultaneously through the use of multiple
    Nasmyth ports and a movable tertiary mirror.
 
 
    APO Facility
    ============
    The APO facility, besides providing support for the 3.5-m telescope,
    also provides support for the entire suite of operations at APO.  Most
    of the observatory daytime work occurs in the Operations building.  The
    3.5-m control room contains computers and monitors that control the
    operations of the 3.5m telescope; this room is located off the main
    hallway of the Operations building.  The 3.5-m work area is used for
    3.5-m general projects and is located at the north end of the main
    hallway. Also included in this area are a conference area, a library,
    alphabetically-filed equipment manuals, and numerically-indexed
    technical drawings.  The library is limited to general reference books
    and publications.
