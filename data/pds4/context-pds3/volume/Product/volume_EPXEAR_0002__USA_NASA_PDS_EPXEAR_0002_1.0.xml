    This dataset contains calibrated, 1.05- to 4.8-micron spectra of
    Earth acquired by the High Resolution Infrared Spectrometer (HRII)
    during the EPOCh and Cruise 2 phases of the EPOXI mission.  Five
    sets of observations were acquired on 18-19 March, 28-29 May and
    04-05 June 2008 and on 27-28 March and 04-05 October 2009 to
    characterize Earth as an analog for extrasolar planets.  Each
    observing period lasted approximately 24 hours, and spectra were
    acquired twice every 2 hours.  During the observing period in May
    2008, the Moon transited across Earth as seen from the spacecraft.
    HRII spectra were not acquired during the first attempt of an Earth
    south polar observation on 27-28 September 2009 because fault
    protection turned that instrument off; the full sequence was
    successfully rerun on 04-05 October 2009.  Version 2 corrects an
    error in the IR absolute calibration that previously inflated all
    spectra by a factor of 2.
